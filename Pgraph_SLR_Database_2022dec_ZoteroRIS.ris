AB  - The challenges to commercialize biomass industry includes biomass supply shortage which is dependent on geographical location and seasonality. Most of the present biomass supply chain studies had not considered incorporation of supply chain uncertainties that may lead to overestimation of financial performance. Therefore, a hybrid framework was proposed via integration of stochastic Monte Carlo Simulation model with element targeting approach (Biomass Element Life Cycle Analysis, BELCA-P-graph model) to perform scheduling and economic analysis for the biomass supply chain. The BELCA-P-graph model aimed to generate a baseline for the feedstock ratio of each input biomass. This was then input into the stochastic model, capable of estimating the financial probability of the supply chain while incorporating supply chain uncertainties (i.e., biomass element characteristics, transportation-related parameters, raw material pricing, biomass availability, market demand, and selling price of final product). Results showed that biomass shortage had decreased the mean Net Present Value (NPV) of the base case scenario (without consideration biomass supply shortage) by 1.39%–12.21%. Storage capacity consideration had decreased the mean NPV by 11.59%–12.21%. The sensitivity analysis found that syngas demand and syngas selling price uncertainty offered significant impact on the mean NPV outcome. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Heat exchanger networks in real industrial processes often have to be designed for varying parameters of the process streams that renders multiperiod heat exchanger network synthesis essential in industrial realization. However, three standing issues must be considered in the synthesis procedure. (1) The generated network should be efficient in all periods, preferably consuming minimum utility. (2) This network should also be structurally as simple as possible for minimizing the investment cost and making the process controllable. Furthermore, (3) all or the n-best networks that fulfilled the first two principles must be considered for the selection of the most preferred industrial realization. The method proposed in the current work satisfies all three requirements simultaneously; it has been the only known method with these properties. The method primarily relies on the formerly developed P-graph-based heat exchanger network synthesis procedure. Three case studies demonstrate the application of the proposed method. © 2022

AB  - Improving the rational use of water and energy resources by optimising the heat supply system using P-Graph tools and additional analysis is discussed in this paper. The proposed approach is based on the decomposition of the heat supply system of a city/settlement into separate districts and optimisation of the thermal energy network between consumers and energy sources. The determination of the optimal structure for the distribution of thermal energy between consumers in each district is carried out using the P-Graph approach and accounting import/export of energy and water resources. An additional analysis of the structure of heat supply systems allows for determining the structure with minimum operating cost, water consumption and emissions. The proposed approach was applied to optimise the heat supply system of Tomsk city. Three configurations of the heat supply system, characterized by different objective functions, were determined as a result of the study. The structure of the heat supply system obtained based on the operating cost minimisation reduces operating costs by 69 million RUB/y; water consumption minimisation decreases water consumption by 27.3 thousand m3/y; emission minimisation has cut emissions by 6,000 tCO2/y and 517 tSO2/y compared to the base case. The approach proposed may be used for the design of heat supply systems by finding the trade-off between the operating cost and the environmental footprint of the heat supply system. It makes it possible to optimise heat supply systems based on the economic and environmental capabilities of the region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein, the formula proposed for quantifying the resilience of engineering systems, including processing systems, is general in several aspects. The structure of a system can be highly complex where the numbers of loops, raw materials, and products are not limited. The mathematical models of the operating units can be either linear or nonlinear for simulating the effect of the failures. The damage caused by an unexpected event can result in various levels of operation for the operating units. The proposed formula is also general in the sense that all possible combinations of failures are considered. The problem formulation, the related structure representation, the enumeration and evaluation of possible failures are based on the P-graph framework and its algorithms. The proposed formula for resilience is applicable to any complex engineering system whose behavior is primarily determined by its structure, including supply chains, information systems, municipal infrastructures, and electrical transmission networks. © 2022

AB  - Input-output analysis is used for modelling economic networks with linear equations representing intersectoral links. These models are used extensively to determine the effects of policies and decisions, taking into account sectoral interdependencies. They have also been used to identify optimal responses to various natural or man-made disruptions. An alternative graph theoretic approach to optimizing input-output systems using P-graph has also been developed. However, that approach is limited by the restrictive assumption of the Leontief production function, where each economic sector requires an invariant set of inputs to produce each unit of output; it is assumed in the basic model that these inputs have no substitutability, since their relative proportions are determined by a fixed state of technology. Relaxing this unrealistic assumption is a critical research gap. An improved P-graph model for optimizing input-output systems with partial substitution is developed in this paper. This modelling approach is demonstrated with two case studies involving energy shortages triggered by extreme weather and by military action. Both examples show that the capacity for partial substitution makes economic systems more robust to disruptions. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: This study is aimed to develop a novel intuitionistic fuzzy P-graph with Gaussian membership function to help decision-makers deal with complex process network systems. Design/methodology/approach: Two fuzzy P-graph case studies of the cogeneration system were selected, and relevant data were collected, including the structure and flow sequence of the system, and the rate of material and product transitions between the operating units. Gaussian function membership was set according to the restriction of fuzzy upper and lower bounds. Then the α-cut was used to obtain different upper and lower bound restrictions of each membership degree. After finding the optimal and suboptimal solutions for different membership degrees, the results of non-membership and hesitation were calculated. Findings: The proposed method will help the decision maker consider the risk and provide more feasible solutions to choose the optimal and suboptimal solutions based on their own or through experience. The proposed model in this study has more flexibility in operation and decision making. Originality/value: This study is the first to propose a novel intuitive fuzzy P-graph and demonstrates the effectiveness and flexibility of the method by two case studies of the cogeneration system. However, the addition of hesitation can increase the error tolerance of the system. Even for the solutions with a high degree of membership, optimal and suboptimal solutions still exist for the decision maker to select. Since decision makers expect the higher achievement of the target requirements; thus, it is important to have more feasible solutions with a high degree of membership. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Biofuel from microalgae is one of the promising solutions on addressing climate change by its possibility of reducing the fossil fuel dependency. Till-date, the overall competitiveness of microalgae based biorefinery is the major concern due to its unique operational mechanism, especially the biological growth of microalgae that fluctuates towards the surrounding. Therefore, a novel graph-theoretic approach has been proposed to provide an optimization approach for identifying optimal process design with the consideration of three aspects that includes: economic, environmental, and reliability. The optimization is conducted using P-graph (a powerful graph-theoretic tool) which is capable to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions based on three objective functions: (i) minimizing annual operating cost, (ii) minimizing potential environmental impact, and (iii) maximizing reliability of process. The pool of feasible solutions (optimal and near-optimal) is obtained by satisfying the constraints on both greenhouse gas emissions and its respective reliability along. Thereupon, a further analysis was carried out with the aid of TOPSIS considering three of the assessment aspects to identify the optimal microalgae biorefinery configuration © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy efficiency and economic viability are the often-quoted issues in aquaponic farming. This work aims to (i) identify process technologies and technical measures which would enhance the profitability of aquaponics business while conserving energy and other resources, and (ii) to validate the determined optimal measures on the testing aquaponics farm. The process network synthesis technique was used to search for an optimal process pathway while the image processing technique was applied to automatically monitor the growth rate of produce since it is the main revenue stream in aquaponics. With the aid of P-graph method, the optimal feasible structure has 9 times higher annual net income than that of the existing process. This optimal solution includes the integration of electrical heat pump, biogas system, and utilizes black solider fly (BSF) facility to produce fish feed. Additional light energy savings were achieved by practical installation of reflective foils which improved 16.88% of Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) on growth beds. These measures can help the aquaponics farms to become more competitive and to decrease their ecological footprint. © 2022

AB  - Analysis on the alternative designs on top of the optimal network has proven valuable and meaningful for the decision-makers in determining the most suitable options which fulfill a wide range of objective functions. On the basis of an extension of the P-graph framework, a procedure was developed previously for multiple-solution heat exchanger network (HEN) synthesis. This procedure is capable of generating the n-best HENs depending on predefined structural constraints, for example, the maximum number of heat exchangers used for the entire system, the maximum number of sequential heat exchangers on each stream, the maximum number of stream splittings per stream. Since the choice of a parameter influences the effect of other parameters on the result, it is difficult to find the proper set of parameters for the solver that result in all plausible solutions to the original problem. Naturally, this issue emerges in any HEN synthesis problem, its systematic treatment is essential. The purpose of the current work was to develop a heuristic framework for determining the most reasonable parameters of the HEN generation algorithm and guiding the designer through the optimization process. The outcome of this study not only benefits the researchers and industrial practitioners of this field but may also be extended for educational purposes. © 2021

AB  - P-graph causality maps were recently proposed as a methodology for systematic analysis of intertwined causal chains forming network-like structures. This approach uses the bipartite representation of P-graph to distinguish system components (“objects” represented by O-type nodes) from the functions they perform (“mechanisms” represented by M-type nodes). The P-graph causality map methodology was originally applied for determining structurally feasible causal networks to enable a desirable outcome to be achieved. In this work, the P-graph causality map methodology is extended to the analysis of vicious networks (i.e., causal networks with adverse outcomes). The maximal structure generation algorithm is first used to assemble the problem elements into a complete causal network; the solution structure generation algorithm is then used to enumerate all structurally feasible causal networks. Such comprehensive analysis gives insights on how to deactivate vicious networks through the removal of keystone objects and mechanisms. The extended methodology is illustrated with an ex post analysis of the 1984 Bhopal industrial disaster. Prospects for other applications to sustainability issues are also discussed.

AB  - Field service operation is a theoretically complex problem. Numerous tasks at various locations need to be assigned to service staff. Skills, capabilities, and the level of local knowledge have to be considered to estimate the time required to complete a task by a group of selected technicians. Multiple objectives involve cost, task priorities, and consumer satisfaction. The cost includes the salary of service staff for a whole route from departing to returning to the base location. The travel cost depends on the proper routing of the service staff and the effective collection of closely located tasks into a single route. Priorities of tasks are defined by a function of their deadlines. Consumer satisfaction is a function of the number of missed appointments. A two-level optimization model is introduced to solve large-scale field service operation problems. At the higher level, tasks are assigned to time intervals based on the capacity and availability of the service groups. Then at the lower level, assigned tasks are exactly scheduled and service routes planned by time-constrained process network synthesis (TCPNS). The execution of the different levels is performed iteratively until the overall work plan cannot be further improved. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - With the rising demand for hydrogen in petrochemical and refineries complexes, the optimisation of hydrogen utility is getting more attention. Through inter-plant hydrogen integration (IPHI), the overall hydrogen consumption and purged gases could be further reduced by exchanging hydrogen gases among multiple plants which could reduce the climate change effect. In this work, a P-graph methodology is proposed for the optimal design of IPHI with regeneration-reuse/recycle via a centralised utility hub. Green hydrogen is incorporated in this work in the call for climate change adaption. A case study involving green hydrogen sourced from solar energy, palm oil mill effluent, and wastewater was used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Four integration schemes were analysed using game theory-based approach for decision making. In IPHI, each participating plant may seek to maximise its own benefits due to rational self-interest. Hence, a game theory-based approach was used to analyse the interaction of participating plants in developing the IPHI schemes. With the implementation of carbon tax, it is potential for motivating collaborations as additional gains can be achieved through collaboration compared to short-sighted self-interest decision. The proposed methodology indicates that collective welfare can be maximised through cooperation among all networks to pursue Pareto optimality and in line with the commitment to tackle climate change and reaching sustainainability agenda. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Renewable energy is the key to decarbonize energy use despite the growing global energy demand. However, energy storage is required to tackle the supply-demand mismatch caused by the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. As each type of energy storage has a distinct discharge duration, a hybrid energy storage system can be more cost-effective than a single energy storage system. While various process integration tools have been employed for the optimization of microgrid with hybrid energy storage, a graph theoretic algorithm known as P-graph allows the identification of optimal and near-optimal solutions for practical decision making. P-graph involves modelling by graphs and the embedded accelerated branch-and-bound algorithm enables efficient determination of optimal solution. This study proposes a multi-period P-graph optimization framework for the optimization of photovoltaic-based microgrid with battery-hydrogen energy storage and the proposed approach is demonstrated through two case studies. Results showed that the optimal cost of microgrid with hybrid battery-hydrogen storage is 704,990 USD/y, a carbon price of 1000 USD/t and above is required to make it more economical than conventional electricity use. Replacing the hydrogen storage system with grid support reduces the total cost and required carbon price to 262,334 USD/y and 300 USD/y respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Material scheduling is significant in the ethylene production process. However, factors such as the production scale and the technology also affect the choice of material scheduling solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel P-graph methodology integrated data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the solutions selection of material scheduling. First, based on the basic procedure, a scheduling superstructure model expanding from the time dimension is built. With the cost as the objective function, the optimal and partially feasible scheduling solutions are generated based on the P-graph, and the results are analyzed in detail with reference to ISA-95. Then the DEA is used to analyze the indicators of material consumption and product yields to give a selection strategy from the input-output perspective. The optimal solution and suboptimal solution sets are evaluated and analyzed, and decision making units (DMUs) with the highest score are calculated. Based on the scheduling solution with the highest score and relatively low cost, the potential adjustment of other solution is also given. Finally, a complete base of material scheduling solution has been implemented, which provides more references for decision makers. This paper considers the lowest cost as the goal and gives a more suitable alternative from the perspective of input-output efficiency in combination with the actual production conditions, which is a good extension of the P-graph. © 2020 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - Most methods developed for water minimization for batch processes were reported based on pinch analysis and mathematical programming. In this work, a recently developed P-graph methodology for direct water reuse/recycle is extended for batch water network. The model allows direct water reuse/recycle when water sources and sinks are both located in the same time intervals, or stored for later use through water storage tank. A literature example is used to demonstrate the extended model. The important feature of P-graph is demonstrated through alternative solutions for the batch water network, with different numbers of water storage tanks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A new class of bipartite causality maps is developed in this work to model influences in socio-technological systems. Unlike earlier forms of causality maps such as fuzzy cognitive maps, this novel approach uses two kinds of elements represented as different types of graph nodes. Based on the P-graph framework, “objects” and their “mechanisms” (or actions) are represented by O-type and M-type nodes, respectively. Objects consist of both tangible (e.g., technologies) and intangible (e.g., policies) elements, while mechanisms are the roles that objects play within the system. Objects in the network influence each other through these mechanisms as indicated by arcs. Two P-graph algorithms are used for this application. First, the maximal structure generation (MSG) is used to generate a maximal causality map based on specifications of local links of individual objects; the causality map assembly is automatic and does not require human understanding of the global problem topology. Next, the solution structure generation (SSG) algorithm is used to algorithmically generate all structurally feasible causality maps for the problem. The alternative networks can be evaluated to gauge practically viable candidate policy and technology combinations. Criticality of different objects can be quantified based on the frequency of occurrence in the enumerated causality maps. The methodology is illustrated using a case study on a policy framework for negative emissions technologies (NETs) for CO2 removal. The potential of this technique to determine how to sustain “virtuous networks” or to deactivate “vicious networks” is also discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The production of renewable fuels and chemicals is a critical component of global strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, pyrolysis oil obtained from biomass comprises hundreds of chemical compounds, thus rendering it a good precursor for manufacturing a variety of fuel products of commercial interest. Despite the large number of contributions describing the products' extraction, upgrading, and potential refining schemes, no bio-oil refinery is currently in operation. The main challenge in building a bio-oil refinery lies in the lack of an economically viable process configuration. Systematic studies comparing alternative refinery concepts, or configurations, are needed to identify the most promising configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use process graph (P-graph) methodology for the synthesis of pyrolysis oil refineries. In particular, this work shows the effectiveness of P-graph methodology in simultaneously calculating the profitability of various biorefinery designs by using data reported in the literature and providing information on how the introduction of new technologies to the database will impact the formation of profitable biorefinery concepts. Our work demonstrates a methodology for the addition of new unit operations to the database generated from the literature. The addition of a centrifuge for water extraction and a wet oxidation system for acetic acid production resulted in the generation of 330 biorefinery configurations, seven of which have a profitability ranging from $1,650 to $23,666/h (USD) with acetic acid and levoglucosan as the main products, respectively. This demonstrates that P-graph methodology is useful for discovering optimum techno-economic scenarios that may otherwise be overlooked. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The increasing demand for hydrogen in refineries and petrochemical plants is challenging these facilities to minimise their hydrogen utility without incurring high capital and operating costs. As environment-related fuel specifications become more stringent, the demand for hydrogen increases, especially for the operation of hydrodesulphurisation in refineries. A P-graph model is developed in this paper for the synthesis of hydrogen networks. The model is capable of generating optimal and near-optimal solutions for the hydrogen network. The proposed methodology is computationally efficient and require minimal understanding of programming language. The developed model includes both direct recycle/reuse and regeneration schemes; and accounts for pressure and impurity constraints in the hydrogen network. In addition, the application of hydrogen header can also be handled by the P-graph model. The methodology is illustrated with three literature examples and the results obtained match those reported in literature. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Agricultural residues can be utilized by developing countries as a feedstock for producing various bioenergy products to be able to meet local demand. Such initiatives may help reduce the dependence of a country on fossil fuel imports and, at the same time, maximize a vast amount of untapped biomass resources. The production of biofuels and biochemicals can be made possible by developing and implementing integrated biorefineries (IBR). An IBR consists of integrated process units that convert biomass into multiple bioenergy products. The design and synthesis of IBRs is a challenging task due to the number of possible pathways in producing a particular product while considering the type of feedstock and equipment. The P-graph (process graph) method is an excellent tool in process network synthesis (PNS) problems, and is an approach based on graph theory and efficient combinatorial algorithms. Its effectiveness in determining an optimal structure for solution recommendations is evident in a number of systems. In this work, a P-graph based approach was used to optimally synthesize an IBR using locally available agricultural waste as input. Optimal and sub-optimal solutions were generated by maximizing hourly profit. A sensitivity analysis on the effect of the price of key products on the optimal solution was conducted. The model was able to solve the problem given a feedstock supply and product demand constraint. Two case studies, a rice- and a corn-based IBR, were used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. From the results, the rice- and corn-based IBRs generated a profit of 376.88 USD/h and 7746.93 USD/h. The difference in profit is mainly driven by the supply of biomass and prices of key products. This work will provide a reference in creating IBR using local feedstock, thereby valorizing agricultural residues. This may enable increased revenues for farmers from the sale of biomass. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wastewater treatment consists of three or four sequential stages: preliminary, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Each stage can comprise multiple alternative technologies that can perform the same tasks with different efficiencies, operating times, and costs. Thus, we propose a systematic approach for designing wastewater treatment networks by utilizing principles of mathematical modeling and generating an exhaustive enumeration of all the possible technologies and their connections during the early stages of designing a treatment facility. Some of these structures are nonintuitive and include recycling, reprocessing, bypasses, and multiple technologies in parallel or series to remove the same contaminant. The nonintuitive structures with multiple technologies may provide a measure of resilience compared to typical heuristic designs. Thus, the combination of P-graph methodology and the sequence of treatment technologies predicted via the optimization algorithm from the maximal structure is based on holistic considerations and does not lead to suboptimal solutions. © 2021 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Modeling technique in the P-Graph framework for operating units with flexible input ratios

AB  - The P-Graph framework is an efficient tool that deals with the solution of Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problems. The model uses a bipartite graph of material and operating unit nodes, with arcs representing material flow. The framework includes combinatorial algorithms to identify solution structures, and an underlying linear model to be solved by the Accelerated Branch and Bound algorithmic method. An operating unit node in a P-Graph consumes its input materials and produces its products in a fixed ratio of operation volume. This makes it inadequate in modeling such real-world operations where input composition may vary, and may also be subject to specific constraints. Recent works address such cases by directly manipulating the generated mathematical model with linear programming constraints. In this work, a new general method is introduced which allows the modeling of operations with flexible input ratios and linear constraints in general, solely by tools provided by the P-Graph framework itself. This includes representing the operation with ordinary nodes and setting up their properties correctly. We also investigate how our method affects the solution structures for the PNS problem which is crucial for the performance of algorithms in the framework. The method is demonstrated in a case study where sustainable energy generation for a plant is present, and the different types of available biomass introduce a high level of flexibility, while consumption limitations may still apply. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The conversion of biomass (or agriculture residues) to organic fertilizer is a common practice in developing countries. This study aims to develop a novel multi-criteria decision-making approach towards sustainable fertilization that incorporates both organic and chemical fertilizers with the consideration of economic, environmental, and health aspects. A case study of oil palm plantation in Malaysia is adopted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. Firstly, global warming potential (GWP) of the fertilizer is identified using life cycle assessment. Then, a P-graph model is developed to identify a pool of feasible fertilizer formulations. A clustering approach is then applied to cluster this formulation pool according to the characteristics. Subsequently, TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution) is applied to rank the obtained fertilizer formulations based on three sustainability indices (i.e., total annual cost, GWP, 3-MCPD esters (3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol) as the ranking from P-graph is merely economically-driven. According to the results, F30 which comprises a combination of 0.96 wt% urea, 1.14 wt% monoammonium phosphate, 0.10 wt% kieserite, and 97.81 wt% palm-based organic fertilizer, is suggested for the oil palm tree. Notably, F30 falls in CO2 credit mode where this formulation possesses environment burden reduction in the entire oil palm industry with negative carbon dioxide emission. The annual cost and GWP of F30 which does not possess any 3-MCPD threat is accounted for 205.26 MYR/year (MYR= Ringgit Malaysia) and -34.78 kg CO2-eqv/year. This formulation is applicable across the growth stage of oil palm after validation comparison among different fertilization practices. © 2020

AB  - Reduction of CO2 emissions from industrial facilities is of utmost importance for sustainable development. Novel process systems with the capability to remove CO2 will be useful for carbon management in the future. It is well-known that major determinants of performance in process systems are established during the design stage. Thus, it is important to employ a systematic tool for process synthesis. This work approaches the design of polygeneration plants with negative emission technologies (NETs) by means of the graph-theoretic approach known as the P-graph framework. As a case study, a polygeneration plant is synthesized for multiperiod operations. Optimal and alternative near-optimal designs in terms of profit are identified, and the influence of network structure on CO2 emissions is assessed for five scenarios. The integration of NETs is considered during synthesis to further reduce carbon footprint. For the scenario without constraint on CO2 emissions, 200 structures with profit differences up to 1.5% compared to the optimal design were generated. The best structures and some alternative designs are evaluated and compared for each case. Alternative solutions prove to have additional practical features that can make them more desirable than the nominal optimum, thus demonstrating the benefits of the analysis of near-optimal solutions in process design. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Process industry enterprises rely heavily on expert experience in production, and expert knowledge is stored in multiple formats like, pictures, texts, videos, etc. Several isolated islands of information or knowledge are formed, and they are difficult to store, share, and expand upon. Therefore, the same procedure appears multiple times in different application scenarios, such as optimization scheduling, optimization operation, or fault diagnosis. If redundant knowledge is paid too much attention, decision-makers will not be able to comprehensively consider business knowledge. Thus, a novel framework is proposed for the process industry to manage procedure knowledge. This paper first divides the detailed procedure of process plants into four layers, that is, raw materials, intermediate materials, operation, and products based on the P-graph theory, which involves virtual hierarchies, nodes, and operations. Second, the domain ontology-based procedure knowledge model is constructed. Finally, two experimental cases, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) and the ethylene production process, are studied to verify the procedure knowledge framework (PKF). The PKF provides a useful foundation for the subsequent construction of a superstructure model based on the P-graph theory and is different from the previous industrial process industrial ontology model. The PKF has a theoretical basis for simulation calculation and makes future work based on PKF more accurate and interpretable. © 2020 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering

AB  - In the tannery industry approximately, 30 - 35 m3 of wastewater (WW) is generated per ton of rawhide processed. The WW comprises high concentrations of salts, ammonia, dye, solvents, and chromium. Of particular interest is chromium, which has been proven to cause dermatological, developmental, and reproductive issues on exposure. Thus, there is a need for appropriate treatment of the tannery WW before it is discharged for natural remediation. However, designing a treatment process is multifaceted due to the availability of multiple technologies that can perform similar tasks and the complex composition of waste streams. This necessitates the treatment to be performed in stages namely, primary, secondary, and tertiary. In some cases, pretreatment is required to enhance the recovery in the following stages. Due to the combinatorial nature of this problem, the P-graph approach, which uses principles from graph theory, can be used to synthesize a treatment pathway by selecting appropriate technologies at each stage, while meeting required purity specifications. Furthermore, the P-graph approach can provide alternate feasible treatment structures ranked based on Economics as well as Sustainability indicators, such as the Sustainable Process Index (SPI). In this work, a tannery WW case study is investigated with multiple stages and treatment technologies. A complex maximal structure is generated comprising all possible technologies, flows, connections, bypasses, mixers, and splitters. The models for each technology involve capital and operating costs, efficiency, and SPI at each stage of the treatment process. This problem is formulated in P-graph and solved using the Accelerated Branch-and-Bound algorithm. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Climate change mitigation can be achieved through the large-scale deployment of different carbon management technologies in industry. Governments will also play an important role in creating regulatory environments that incentivize low-carbon investments by self-interested private firms. In game theory, a class of problems known as Stackelberg (or leader-follower) games can be used to model such government-industry interactions. In a Stackelberg game, government is represented as an upper-level decision-maker (leader) and industry acts as the lower-level decision-maker (follower). The government's problem is to set regulations and incentives so that industry's rational profit-maximizing reaction aligns closely with the government objectives; the latter is assumed to be directed towards environmental protection on behalf of the general public. In this work, a P-graph based approach to solving a special class of Stackelberg game is developed. The leader is assumed to have binary variables for technology options, while the follower controls binary and continuous variables within the process networks formed by the available options (i.e., determined by the leader). The algorithm is illustrated on a case study involving the deployment of different negative emissions technologies (NETs). The combined use of biochar (BC) and direct air capture (DAC) is found to give near-optimal land and water footprints for the leader when the follower optimizes for cost. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - A sustainable integrated biorefinery (SIBR) is a biomass processing facility that converts agricultural wastes or residues into a wide range of valuable products where both economic sustainability and environmental sustainability are optimized. This work proposed a hybrid method that incorporates Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool with the P-graph (process-graph) framework. The proposed VIKOR - P-graph model can (i) generate a set of combinatorically feasible solutions, and (ii) rank the solution sets using VIKOR method, simultaneously in the same P-graph model. In other words, all the drawbacks attributed to the sequential optimization methods can, therefore, be avoided. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid methodology, a case study in the Philippines is presented in this paper. The hybrid P-graph model generated a total of 7 feasible solutions with different configuration for the SIBR based on the overall profit (i.e., economic goal) and carbon emissions (i.e., environmental goal). Results show that the best compromised solution can be obtained when majority (70 %) of the rice husk is used to produce bioethanol, where the required power is supplied by combusting the remaining rice husk and by importing external power. It offers an hourly profit of 161 $/h with a lower (~38.6 %) carbon emissions as compared to the most profitable option (3.504 tCO2-eq/h). This research is essentially a guide for policymakers to make informed decisions that can maximise the benefits of SIBR on a national scale. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Bioenergy parks are typically composed of separate biomass-processing plants that have agreed to collaborate via material and energy product synergies to achieve more sustainable operations. The inability of one or more component plants to provide the agreed demand for a product will cause cascading disruptions in the entire network. The inoperability in a bioenergy plant can be caused by a reduction in available raw materials, internal equipment malfunctions, or delays in transporting goods within the supply chain. Despite the disruption, bioenergy parks can continue their operation by optimizing the network's allocation of the material streams. In this work, a P-graph method is developed to optimally adjust operations of a bioenergy park under capacity disruptions. This model considers the effects of deviating from the baseline demand by introducing a penalty rate. This penalty is a financial cost to be deducted from the bioenergy park's optimal economic potential as a result of not being able to meet contractual obligations. A bioenergy park case study is chosen to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Results show that there is about a three-fold further decrease in the optimal profit when penalty rates are applied in the model. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - P-graph models of economic networks based on the Leontief input-output framework have been demonstrated in previous work. However, such models are subject to the limiting assumption of fixed technical coefficients that reflect the average state of technology currently in use. This limitation restricts the use of such models to incremental changes; more radical shifts in economic structure cannot be adequately represented. In this paper, a modified P-graph model of economic networks that allows partial substitution of inputs is developed. This modified formulation can represent major structural shifts, such as deep decarbonization or increased circularity, that are needed for improving the sustainability of modern economies. The new model is illustrated using a hypothetical case study. Results show that economic systems which allow for partial substitution are more resilient when disruptions occur in certain sectors of the economy. © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - An integrated biorefinery (IBR) is a potential source of sustainable energy, biochemicals, and other high-value products. This biomass processing facility is developed by maximizing material and energy product (or byproduct) exchanges between process units within an industrial plant. In the Philippines, vast amounts of agricultural residues (e.g., rice husk) remain to be tapped for bioenergy production. Aside from this, designing a viable and sustainable IBR is a challenging task due to the highly integrated nature of this system. In this work, a P-graph (process graph) based method is applied to generate optimal and near-optimal IBR configurations utilizing Philippine agricultural waste as feedstock whose objective is to maximize profitability. The P-graph framework was initially created to solve process network synthesis (PNS), but recently, researchers extended its use beyond the PNS domain (i.e., integrated systems). In addition, the P-graph software presents the results in a graphical interface, a distinct advantage compared to other optimization techniques. A case study utilizing waste from rice production in the Philippines is used to demonstrate the methodology. The resulting model shows the optimal configuration of the IBR and the maximum profit generated 1,208.17 USD/h. Local government units can use results from this work in creating policies to maximize bioenergy production and increase the revenue generation of farmers. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Ethylene production plants have great differences in terms of equipment, technology, and yields. Moreover, the production cost and carbon emission are closely related to the solution of feedstock scheduling. Therefore, how to choose a reasonable solution of feedstock scheduling is a great challenge for decision makers. Traditional modeling and selection strategies are involved with a large number of parameters and data. Fortunately, the superstructure base on process graph (P-Graph) is friendly to decision makers in both modeling and optimization. However, when the required solution is missing from the case base, the superstructure needs to be constructed and optimized again, which will consume a lot of resources and costs. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel reasoning strategy based on extensible P-Graph. In the proposed methodology, P-Graph is regarded as the basic method of superstructure optimization. In the absence of available solutions, a reasoning strategy is integrated into extensible P-Graph to obtain new feedstock scheduling solutions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, three cases of missing structural schemes, missing parameters and structural solutions, and missing target features are carried out. Simulation results indicate that the proposed methodology can provide a good solution selection strategy with decision makers, and the final required solution can be found. In addition, the burden of modeling and optimization can be greatly reduced. ©

TI  - Maximal structure generation of superstructure for semantic triple generated by DEVS ontology in the process industry
AU  - Cao, J.

T2  - Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems
AB  - In the process industry, a large number of multi-source heterogeneous data are generated. Ontology combined with resource description framework (RDF) is a great way to describe multi-source heterogeneous data. Due to the characteristics of free extension, no model limitations and few constraints in the calculation process, semantic data have been increasingly used in industrial systems. However, semantic data have not been fully utilized to realize automatic modeling. Lots of time and experience from knowledge workers is still required in the feedstock scheduling. Therefore, this article presents a method of constructing the RDF triple graph data based on the discrete event system specification ontology. Based on the advantage of graph data, the procedure of superstructure generation is greatly simplified by the proposed RDFMSG (maximal structure generation based on resource description framework data) algorithm. In the RDFMSG algorithm, the original structure is no longer pruned and then reorganized; the superstructure can be generated by the traversing RDF data set only once. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology are verified through three cases. In addition, the representation of the discrete event system specification ontology can achieve good performance. Furthermore, the combination explosion caused by set operation can be greatly reduced, indicating that the strategy of the RDFMSG plays an important role in the solution structure generation algorithm and the accelerated branch and bound algorithm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The practical problem to be computer aided as a motivational case study is custom printed napkin manufacturing. A process network synthesis based solution is presented that, along with time constraints, can handle scheduling problems while providing clear visual modelling by P-graphs. All the degrees of freedom and limitations of manufacturing process were modelled, and a software module has been implemented to automatically generate optimal production plans. Specialties of the motivational example have to be taken into account, e.g., the optimal selection of the orders to produce in the forthcoming shifts, consumer priorities, deadlines, and the available amounts of raw materials. Moreover, the volumes of each individual production orders have to be optimally shared among multiple candidate equipment units while counting the changeover times. The proposed time-constraint process network synthesis approach is capable to handle all these specialties and provide optimal production schedule by automatically generating and solving a single mathematical programming model. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Huge generation of oil palm biomass has stimulated the development of biorefineries for synthesis of bioproducts. By targeting the palm oil industry and the biorefineries as the consumers of these products, a sustainable circular economy can be created by recycling the biomass wastes to the said consumers. To evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of the sustainable circular economy, a mathematical model demonstrating the biomass network with consideration of recycling is developed in this work. Besides, Process Graph (P-graph) is incorporated to perform the combinatorial optimization of the biomass network, which targets three common resources: fertilizer, steam, and electricity for regeneration and recycling. Although the result shows that the linear economy model is preferred in terms of profitability, the circular economy model shows potential in reducing 39.292% of the imported steam and 13.469% of the imported electricity, while being 0.642% lower in terms of the gross profit. Three scenarios are then proposed to identify the potential bottleneck that can hinder the implementation of the sustainable circular economy approach, with the aid of sensitivity analysis. This work is expected to benefit the biomass-based industry sectors and the policymakers on future development and transition to the sustainable circular economy. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The synthesis of heat recovery networks traditionally results in an optimal or suboptimal solution for the supplied set of streams and simplifying assumptions. In the current work, the assumption of a single optimal solution is replaced by the goal of generating an ordered set of optimal or quasi-optimal networks. This enables industrial engineers to further select the solution most suitable for detailed design and practical implementation. The problem is formulated for and solved by an extension of the P-graph framework for combinatorial process network optimization. The presented method for HEN synthesis generates a list of solutions ranked by the Total Annualized Cost. In addition to the feasibility, all list elements also feature a degree of heat recovery ranging from the thermodynamic maximum, down to a specified margin allowing accounting for the energy-capital trade-off. The current method is illustrated with three case studies. The obtained results demonstrate optimal solutions that cannot be generated by the Pinch-based methods or the stage-wise superstructure approaches. The proposed parameters, an upper limit on the number of heat exchangers per process stream and a maximum relaxation of utility demand compared to the Pinch targets, allow performing parametric evaluations of the resulting solutions. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The shift from conventional hydrogen production that utilised fossil-based energy towards a more sustainable practice is essential. Recently, the interest in utilising renewable hydrogen sources associated with bio-gas has risen. This work aims to develop a P-graph methodology for bio-hydrogen network synthesis, where oil refineries and ammonia plants act as bio-hydrogen sinks, while palm oil mills serve as the bio-hydrogen sources. The latter produces huge amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) which may be converted to bio-hydrogen. The model is optimised with the aim to minimise the total network cost, whilst fulfilling the demand of all hydrogen sinks. Two case studies in Malaysia are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that the overall network cost can be reduced by 45.6% (first case study) and 85.8% (second case study) when bio-hydrogen is supplied from the abundant POME in the study areas. Besides, the capability of the proposed P-graph framework in conducting uncertainty analysis and technology benchmarking study, are also demonstrated. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Off-grid renewable energy systems provide opportunities to give electricity and other utilities to remote communities. Such communities may not have access to electricity, cooling, and purified water, or may require diesel-powered generators for such requirements. Mini- or micro-hydroelectric plants can be the core of facilities to meet these needs where there are sufficiently large rivers and favourable terrain. Such systems have advantages over solar or wind power in having minimal short-term fluctuations that necessitate the use of storage or back-up systems. Part of the power can be drawn off for drinking water purification or ice production. However, during drought, these facilities can suffer from a drop in output, in which case decision support would be needed to determine the optimal abnormal operating state during the crisis. A fuzzy P-graph approach is developed to determine the optimal solution in consideration of multiple product demands. Membership functions of the product demands are used to calibrate the degree of tolerable shortage based on community needs. The methodology is illustrated with a case study of a system operating under drought conditions. Results show that having a twin turbine MHP reduces the need to use a diesel back-up system, except in cases of extreme drought. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Industrial sites are being built increasingly more complex, thus making it difficult to effect rapid and safe evacuations. The optimal evacuation plan depends on the types and locations of threats in addition to the site's layout; moreover, it is necessary to determine the plan in real time when the events are detected. In such emergency scenarios, determining an optimal or near optimal plan, in terms of the egress time, entails the evaluation of numerous alternative evacuation routes. This problem is highly convoluted because of its combinatorial nature; thus, it is highly desirable or even essential, to have access to optimization techniques to solve it. In the present contribution, an algorithmic optimization method is presented to plan evacuation strategies in the chemical industry, in terms of the egress time, supported by software tools. This method uses the graph-theoretic approach based on P-graphs, which exploits the combinatorial nature of the problem, thus providing optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. The method is illustrated by applying it to the evacuation of various industrial site configurations. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Assembly industry plays a key role in Central and Eastern Europe. Large companies and their subcontractors manufacture automotive and electronic products from components, employing a significant number of human resources. Due to the growing labor shortage, it is critical that the production lines should be optimally loaded, i.e., the tasks have to be evenly distributed among the workstations according to their cycle times. In this article a novel formulation of the problem by process graphs or P-graphs is presented leading in an easy to follow visual definition of the potential task to employee allocations, as well as the options to generate a mathematical programming model algorithmically, to be solved by general purpose solvers or get the optimal and alternative N-best allocations by P-graph software. In addition to the theoretical presentation, the article shows the results achieved by applying the proposed methodology in a real-world environment in a computer assembly plant. The P-graph approach provides visual modeling by graphs in a graphical editor and helps understand the relations of decision variables while generating the corresponding mathematical model, which can be generalized for a class of problems and rebuilt according to actual data. As a result, the basis for rigorous mathematical optimization-based decision support can be built up according to graphical models easily understandable by end users as well. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Due to the expanding concern on cleaner production and sustainable development aspects, a technology shift is needed for the hydrogen production, which is commonly derived from natural gas. This work aims to synthesise a large-scale bio-hydrogen network in which its feedstock, i.e., bio-methane, is originated from landfill gas and palm oil mill effluent (POME). Landfill gas goes through a biogas upgrader where high-purity bio-methane is produced, while POME is converted to bio-methane using anaerobic digestor (AD). The generated bio-methane is then distributed to the corresponding hydrogen sink (e.g., oil refinery) through pipelines, and subsequently converted into hydrogen via steam methane reforming (SMR) process. In this work, P-graph framework is used to determine a supply network with minimum cost, while ensuring the hydrogen demands are satisfied. Two case studies in theWest and East Coasts of Peninsular Malaysia are used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed model. In Case Study 1, four scenarios on theWest Coast have been considered, showing total cost saving ranging between 25.9% and 49.5%. This showed that aside from the positive environmental impact, the incorporation of bio-hydrogen supply can also be economically feasible. Such benefits can also be seen in Case Study 2, where the uptake of biogas from landfill and POME sources on the East Coast can lead to a 31% reduction on total network cost. In addition, the effect of bio-hydrogen supply network on carbon footprint reduction was analysed in this work. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Valorization of productive chains based on crops is of utmost interest for countries with potential for obtaining products from agricultural resources. In this regard, this contribution explores the valorization of sugarcane through the diversification of products for one of its derivatives: lactic acid (LA). A set of chemical processes yielding valuable products, such as esters and polylactic acid, was synthesized by means of the P-graph methodology. The operating units considered were evaluated by simulation with Aspen Plus and MATLAB to estimate the profit of various flowsheets involving such units. The P-graph methodology identified the best process, with a profit of 31.9 million USD/y. In addition, the methodology identified 124 alternative processes to use LA, some of which exhibited interesting features, such as process safety or energy robustness, despite exhibiting lower profit. Methyl lactate was identified as a key product for valorization in view of the additional valuable products that are generated from it. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aimed to transition localized hybrid renewable energy microgrid system in multiple regions by integrating excess renewable electricity and carbon dioxide generated with biogas produced in wastewater treatment plant. The integrated optimization network in this contribution addresses the following aspects: (1) biogas supply-demand distribution network, (2) hydrogen production technology allocation involving steam methane reforming and electrolysis, (3) carbon dioxide allocation, and (4) utilization of external resources. The proposed framework is mathematically expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize total annual cost which will be solved by graphical optimization approach, P-graph. A case study of the existing petrochemical industry complex in South Korea has been applied to the developed model. Feasible configuration for meeting base hydrogen demand (7200 tons H2/year) has been proposed with total annual cost of 75,772,460 US $/year. Apart from base hydrogen demand, the developed model is verified with the increase of hydrogen demand for 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. Nonetheless, scenario of tight environmental regulations enforcement has been established among all cases where carbon dioxide emitted within the system will be captured and sequestrated. Pareto Frontier Analysis and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) have been implemented to enhance the overall sustainability by re-ranking the pool of near-optimal solutions to propose new sustainable configuration with the consideration of both economic and environmental aspects (i.e., 40% increase of hydrogen demand; Before: 142,579,000 US $/year, 109,933.00 tons CO2/year; After: 142,651,000 US $/year, 109,845.00 tons CO2/year). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Raw material management plays a vital role in the environment production and carbon emission problem. A P-graph is an effective tool that can be used to solve the raw material management problem. However, raw material management based on the P-graph is complicated and inaccurate. Thus, an improved P-graph integrating carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA-P-graph) method was proposed to resolve raw material management problem with simpler structures and less results. The proposed method was applied in raw material planning in terms of the regional energy planning problem, and two ethylene plants under carbon emission constraints were examined. As the parameter information of the problem was utilized by pinch technology, the search domain of structure optimization was further reduced, and the computing complexity was reduced, while the advantages of the P-graph multi-solution are guaranteed. The experimental results demonstrated the validity of the proposed method. Also, the CEPA-P-graph could reduce the complexity of solution structure generation by ~70% and reduced the carbon emission per unit product by 17%.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the issues associated with the growth of economic and urban population. The aim of this study is to develop an integrated design of waste management systems in support of a Circular Economy by P-graph (a bipartite graphical optimisation tool) as an effective decision support tool. The case study considers four MSW compositions based on different country income levels. Solving the P-graph model identifies the most suitable treatment approaches, considering the economic balance between the main operating cost, type, yield, quality of products, as well as the GHG emission (externality cost). The identification of near-optimal solutions by P-graph is useful in dealing with the trade-offs between conflicting objectives, e.g. local policy and practical implementation, that are difficult to monetise. For a lower-income country, the optimal solution includes a combination of at source separation, recycling, incineration (heat, electricity), anaerobic digestion (biofuel, digestate) and the landfill. It avoids an estimated 411 kg CO2eq/t of processed MSW and achieves a potential profit of 42 €/t of processed MSW. The optimisation generally favours mechanical biological treatment as the country income level rises, which affects the composition of the MSW. The relative prices of biofuel, electricity and heat (&gt;20%) cause a significant impact on the highest-ranking treatment structure and overall profit. This study shows that the developed framework by P-graph is an effective tool for MSW systems planning. For future study, localised data inputs can be fed into the proposed framework for a customised solution and economic feasibility assessment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In developing countries such as in Africa, rural areas are not always connected to the national or regional electric grid. As there is a huge potential for solar energy production, photovoltaics are established to supply electricity for operating critical infrastructures with battery systems and diesel generators installed for redundancy. These systems have the potential for further utilization. As a first step, overproduction of solar energy is offered to households due to simple control rules observing battery levels. This paper proposes an optimization method for energy allocation by process graphs or P-graphs. The method provides preliminary estimations on optimal periodical energy balances between energy producers, storage, and consumers of different priorities. These preliminary estimations serve as reconciliation parameters for advanced real-time control of energy distribution. Each step of transforming the practical problem of multiperiod energy distribution to the language of process network synthesis and then optionally to mathematical programming is detailed. To represent the problem adequately, the original formulation of process network synthesis is extended to take into account potential targets and intermediate entities that cannot be accumulated. The work aims to provide better utilization of renewable energy sources and storage. The microgrid profit and return of investment can also be improved by the proposed methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Process Integration via the cogeneration energy system is widely utilised for its ability to generate both electricity and usable heat simultaneously. However, the decision to integrate a cogeneration energy system in an energy portfolio requires a synchronous analysis of multiple objectives. Previous work in the field introduced a novel fuzzy P-graph approach for the optimal synthesis of cogeneration and polygeneration systems. In this paper, an integrated evaluation framework using the fuzzy P-graph has been proposed. The conflicting objectives are introduced as indicators in the modelling framework for targeting purposes. The acceptable range of the said objectives is transformed into fuzzy limits. A case study from previous work is adapted to evince the potential of the developed model. The result shows that both demand and cost indicators can be targeted at the same time, allowing the multi-objective decision-making problem in the energy system design to be tackled effectively. © 2020 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

AB  - Chemical process simulation has become one of the most important tools for the analysis of process networks. The simulation software currently available are not capable of automatically generating the process structure, the designer must provide it as an input for the simulation. This limits the contribution of simulation to the latter stages of design after the structure has been clearly defined. Since the P-graph methodology was originally conceived to generate process structures systematically, it can be used to produce the topology of the problem automatically based on rigorous combinatorial axioms and algorithms. In this work, the properties of two P-graph algorithms are exploited to automatically generate alternative structures in a commercial simulator, conferring the latter an improved capacity to assist during the early stage of design. Initially, the maximal structure generation (MSG) algorithm is employed to identify a rigorous superstructure from the initial set of plausible operating units. The solution structure generation (SSG) algorithm is then used to enumerate all combinatorially feasible processes included in the superstructure. Each process structure is individually exported to Aspen Plus®, where rigorous models are used to simulate its performance. A set of alternative processes ranked by their economic performance can be generated. This integrated methodology is employed in a case study for producing methyl lactate from methanol and lactic acid. This work demonstrates that integration of P-graph with rigorous simulation constitutes an enhanced tool for process synthesis that automates the generation of process alternatives, providing useful information and additional insight of the synthesis problem. © 2020 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

AB  - Identification of appropriate clean technologies for industrial implementation requires systematic evaluation based on a set of criteria that normally reflect economic, technical, environmental and other aspects. Such multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems involve rating a finite set of alternatives with respect to multiple potentially conflicting criteria. Conventional MADM approaches often involve explicit trade-offs in between criteria based on the expert's or decision maker's priorities. In practice, many experts arrive at decisions based on their tacit knowledge. This paper presents a new induction approach, wherein the implicit preference rules that estimate the expert's thinking pathways can be induced. P-graph framework is applied to the induction approach as it adds the advantage of being able to determine both optimal and near-optimal solutions that best approximate the decision structure of an expert. The method elicits the knowledge of experts from their ranking of a small set of sample alternatives. Then, the information is processed to induce implicit rules which are subsequently used to rank new alternatives. Hence, the expert's preferences are approximated by the new rankings. The proposed induction approach is demonstrated in the case study on the ranking of Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) viability for industry implementation. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The P-graph framework was developed to solve Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problems in plant design. It provides a powerful engineering toolbox based on the constituent Maximal Structure Generation (MSG), Solution Structure Generation (SSG) and Accelerated Branch-and-Bound (ABB) algorithms. During the four decades of its development, the P-graph framework has proven to be capable of solving various engineering applications framed as PNS problems. This review paper gives a survey of the development of the P-graph framework, with emphasis on its enhancements and the diversification of applications in process engineering. Research gaps and promising directions for P-graph research are then discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Heat-integrated water network (HIWN) is an active area of research in the past decade. It focuses on simultaneous saving of energy and water, which are both important resources to enhance sustainability for the process plants. This problem has been previously approached using insight-based pinch analysis and mathematical programming techniques. In this work, an alternative optimization tool, process graph (P-graph) framework is utilized to solve for water and energy integration. P-graph is a graph-theoretic approach to process synthesis, for which the developed algorithms can reduce the complexity of the mathematical programming algorithms efficiently. P-graph methodology enables the effective generation of sub-optimal network structures that allow wider exploration of alternatives through network topology. This paper also introduces some transformation techniques to convert the non-linear programming (NLP) model in the non-isothermal HIWN problem into model which is solvable using P-graph. Two examples with different water recovery schemes are used to elucidate the proposed approach, covering both direct recycle/reuse and regeneration networks; for both cases, isothermal and non-isothermal mixing problems are solved. © 2019

AB  - Because of the ever increasing complexity of processing systems, the reliability becomes a key aspect in selecting the best process during process design. This is especially crucial if heat integration is also part of process design, because it increases the complexity of the system that may reduce its reliability. Since the selection of a process network during synthesis has major influence on the cost, the reliability, and the level of heat integration, these three items must be considered simultaneously in process synthesis. To do so, a general modeling tool is required that simultaneously covers all three areas. In the present work, three formerly developed modeling tools and solution procedures are adapted and integrated, all of them are related to the P-graph framework. Because of their common basis, their integration is natural and highly effective. In addition to the three aspects considered here in synthesizing a process, there are further features to be considered in the final selection of the best process during process design (e.g., controllability and sustainability). The capability of the method in generating all or the n-best networks serves this purpose. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As most of the energy production and transformation processes are safety-critical, it is vital to develop tools that support the analysis and minimisation of their reliability-related risks. The resultant optimisation problem should reflect the structure of the process which requires the utilisation of flexible and problem-relevant models. This paper highlights that P-graphs extended by logical condition units can be transformed into reliability block diagrams, and based on the cut and path sets of the graph a polynomial risk model can be extracted which opens up new opportunities for the definition optimisation problems related to reliability redundancy allocation. A novel multi-objective optimisation based method has been developed to evaluate the criticality of the units and subsystems. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated using a real-life case study related to a reforming reaction system. The results highlight that P-graphs can serve as an interface between process flow diagrams and polynomial risk models and the developed tool can improve the reliability of energy systems in retrofitting projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study deals with the problem of human resources planning due to the additional workforce requirements of research activities. In practice, planning of human resource expansion is seldom done in a systematic manner, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, a P-graph model is developed as a decision support tool to aid in planning expansion of staffing levels for Higher Education Institutions. Many higher education institutions in the developing world are undergoing the transition from being teaching-intensive to becoming increasingly research-oriented. This shift is widely recognized as an important adjustment to the need for universities to play a greater role in creating knowledge capital, which is an essential component to fuel the next phase of growth of developing countries. Research universities are an essential resource for facilitating eco-innovation in industry. New targets that involve increased research output tend to put strain on institutional processes and resources that were previously configured to meet the demands of teaching-intensive organizations. The model formulation is based on an input-output framework that reflects interdependencies among different employee categories. The use of the model is illustrated with a representative case study of a typical Higher Education Institution in the Philippines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Testing is an indispensable process for ensuring product quality in production systems. Reducing the time and cost spent on testing whilst minimising the risk of not detecting faults is an essential problem of process engineering. The optimisation of complex testing processes consisting of independent test steps is considered. Survival analysis-based models of an elementary test to efficiently combine the time-dependent outcome of the tests and costs related to the operation of the testing system were developed. A mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to formalize how the total cost of testing depends on the sequence and the parameters of the elementary test steps was proposed. To provide an efficient formalization of the scheduling problem and avoid difficulties due to the relaxation of the integer variables, the MINLP model as a P-graph representation-based process network synthesis problem was considered. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated by a realistic case study taken from the computer manufacturing industry. With the application of the optimal test times and sequence provided by the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver, 0.1–5% of the cost of the testing can be saved. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Process-network synthesis is the determination of the optimal network structure of a process system together with optimal configurations and capacities of the operating units incorporated into the system. The aim of developing more and more sophisticated solver algorithms is to find the optimum as fast as possible and increase the circle of practically solvable process synthesis problems. The P-graph framework can effectively reduce the number of structures to be examined and accelerate the computation searching for the optimum due to the exploitation of combinatorial characteristics of candidate solution structures. A cooperative parallel implementation of P-graph algorithms have been published recently to exploit the capabilities of multi-core and multiprocessor systems (Bartos and Bertok in De Gruyter Ser Logic Appl 1:303–313, 2015). The parallel implementation has increased performance significantly but this can be further improved by fine tuning the parameters of the parallel algorithm. Outcomes of experiments on parameter optimization are to be presented herein. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Reliability is naturally one of the most important properties of processing systems, still there is no general method that is capable of simultaneously considering the reliability during the design procedure. Consequently, the optimality of the decisions in process design cannot be guaranteed. The main reason of the lack of general method is that the process design and the reliability engineering are based on different types of mathematical modelling tools. While process design traditionally considered as mixed-integer optimization, reliability engineering is based on probability theory, therefore, a general modelling tool is required that can conveniently cover these two areas. In the present work, it has been shown that the formerly developed combinatorial approach to process network synthesis, the so-called P-graph framework, can conveniently cover and integrate these two areas. The method for reliability analysis of processing systems is general and can effectively analyze complex, highly interconnected networks. Furthermore, the reliability analysis method given here can be embedded to process design tools. A formerly unavailable formula, the system reliability formula has also been defined for processing networks. The focus of the present work is on structures of processing systems, all statements and algorithms are general and proved. The solutions of challenging real problems are also given. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Industrial applications nowadays are facing the complexity of the problem of finding an optimal energy supply composition. Heating and electricity needs vary throughout a year and need to be addressed. There is usually power available from the market, but a company has other investment options to consider, such as solar power, or utilization of local biomass. Fixed and proportional investment and operational costs must be compared to long-term cost-efficiency. The P-Graph framework is an effective tool in the design and synthesis of process networks, and is capable of showing optimal decisions. In the present work, a new P-Graph model was implemented to address the synthesis of the energy supply options of a manufacturing plant in Hungary. Compared to the original approach, a multi-periodic scheme was applied for heating and electricity demands. Also, the pelletizer and biogas plant investments are modeled in the P-Graph with a new technique that better reflects equipment capacities and flexible input ratios. The best solutions in this case study in terms of total costs are listed. It can be concluded that a long-term investment horizon is needed for the incorporation of sustainable energy sources into the system to be cost-efficient. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The application of biochar to soil is a potentially significant way to achieve negative net emissions. Photosynthesis fixes carbon from the atmosphere during plant growth; subsequently, pyrolysis stabilizes the carbon in biomass into recalcitrant form, which results in long-term storage when the carbonized product is put in soil. However, effective planning of such Biochar-based Carbon Management Networks is needed to ensure that benefits are maximized, and that adverse consequences are mitigated. The objective of this work is to develop a P-graph methodology for planning Biochar-based Carbon Management Networks, where pyrolysis plants act as sources, while the agricultural lands that receive the biochar act as sinks. Two problem variants are considered. In the first case study, the allocation of biochar is constrained by the presence of contaminants that exist naturally in the biomass or are formed during pyrolysis, such that only 72.5% of the available biochar is applied to soil. In the second case study, the distribution of biochar is limited both by the ultimate soil carbon limit, as well as annual application rates at each site; 88.9% of the available biochar is used in the optimal solution. The P-graph framework also generates near-optimal network topologies, which present alternative solutions that can be useful for the large-scale implementation of Biochar-based Carbon Management Networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Freight transportation has always been a key factor in industry and market supply and expanding markets relies on its efficacy even more. Uncertainty cannot be avoided in transportation, e.g., traffic or navigability of rivers, and stochastic nature impacts contracts between a firm and a transport company. It is essential to analyze the conditions of contracts, whether they have medium or short term validity, e.g., one costs less while other offers more flexibility. Medium term scenario analysis can be formulated as a two-stage decision problem typically handled by methods applying decision trees. Since realistic problems are complex enough to result in a decision tree of enormous size, application of such methods is practically limited. Our study presents a computer aided algorithmic method based on P-graph framework, which is capable to implicitly involve and enumerate all feasible scenarios instead of explicitly enumerate the possibilities, while keeping the problem formulation compact and visible. © 2018

AB  - Knowledge generation is the basis of industrial knowledge automation. Process industry knowledge is usually generated by directed tasks, such as optimization scheduling, optimization operation, fault diagnosis, etc. The solution generation requires not only understanding the operation mechanism and production data, but also relying on domain expert experience. Such forms of knowledge representation are difficult to unify, poorly ported, and inconvenient to share and reuse. Aiming at the problem of resource scheduling optimization of ethylene cracking furnace group, the P-graph method is used to construct the superstructure model of the solution, which is designed to represent the knowledge of P-graph ontology and database mapping into knowledge rules, and automatically generate RDF (resource description framework) represents the solution knowledge and builds a knowledge repository. Finally, the actual production data of the ethylene production plant was used to verify the feasibility and practicability of the proposed method. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - There are differences in equipment and technology between different cracking devices in the ethylene industry. There is also a difference in the yield and energy consumption of ethylene products from cracking devices of different furnace types or processes in each ethylene feedstock plant. With the commissioning and starting of the new ethylene plant, it is necessary to simultaneously operate a large number of differential cracking devices, thereby providing space for the optimization of ethylene cracking raw materials to achieve improved material efficiency and lower energy consumption. This paper proposes a modeling and optimization method based on P-graph for the scheduling of raw materials and energy optimization among such plants(SGBP). This algorithm extracts the structural information of the process by P-graph itself, and preserves the suboptimal solution set while accelerating the solution. Afterwards, using a certain ethylene plant as an example, the proposed method was applied to achieve the modeling and optimization of raw material scheduling. The advantages of the proposed method has been verified via comparing with MINLP and one kind of intelligent optimization algorithm. It can provide simultaneously more abundant optimal solution and suboptimal solution. The optimal result of the proposed method is equivalent to the optimization effect of MINLP. The overall energy consumption after optimization is significantly reduced, and a variety of alternative operation options can be provided for the production plan personnel to choose flexible raw material deployment plans. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - P-graph framework that was originally developed for processing network synthesis (PNS), has been extended to heat exchanger network synthesis (HENS). On the basis of the new formulation, PNS and HENS can be solved simultaneously by adapting the formerly developed P-graph algorithms. Therefore, the optimality of the overall synthesis procedure can be guaranteed, which is not possible for the traditional sequential procedures of PNS and HENS. The solution of a case study illustrates that the process structure determined by the simultaneous approach can be substantially different from the structure generated by the sequential approach, naturally, the former is the optimal solution.

AB  - P-graph is a graph-theoretic method which is designed to solve process network synthesis (PNS) problem using combinatorial and optimisation algorithms. Due to its visual interface for data encoding and results display; and its capability of generating multiple solutions (optimal and sub-optimal) simultaneously, the utility of P-graph has expanded into a broad range of studies recently. However, this powerful graph-theoretic method still falls short of dealing with non-linear problems. The problem can be found from the cost estimation provided by P-graph software. Despite it allows users to input the sizing cost (noted as “proportional cost” in P-graph software), the capacity and the cost are assumed to be linearly correlated. This inaccurate and unreliable cost estimation has increased the difficulty of making optimal decisions and therefore lead to undesirable profit loss. This paper proposes to solve the fundamental linearity problem by implementing trained artificial neural networks (ANN) into P-graph. To achieve this, an ANN model which utilised thresholded rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is developed in a segregated computational tool. The identified neurons are then modelled in P-graph in order to convert the input into the nonlinear output. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an illustrative case study of biomass transportation is used. With the use of the trained neurons, the non-linear estimation of transportation cost which considered fuel consumption cost, vehicle maintenance cost and labour cost are successfully modelled in P-graph. This work is expected to pave ways for P-graph users to expand the utility of P-graph in solving other more complex non-linear problems. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasing globally every year, including in Malaysia. Approaching the year 2020, Malaysia still has MSW disposal issues since most waste goes to landfills rather than being utilized as energy. Process network synthesis (PNS) is a tool to optimize the conversion technologies of MSW. This study optimizes MSW conversion technologies using a PNS tool, the "process graph" (P-graph). The four highest compositions (i.e., food waste, agriculture waste, paper, and plastics) of MSW generated in Malaysia were optimized using a P-graph. Two types of conversion technologies were considered, biological conversion (anaerobic digestion) and thermal conversion (pyrolysis and incinerator), since limited data were available for use as optimization input. All these conversion technologies were compared with the standard method used: landfilling. One hundred feasible structure were generated using a P-graph. Two feasible structures were selected from nine, based on the maximum economic performance and minimal environmental impact. Feasible structure 9 was appointed as the design with the maximum economic performance (MYR 6.65 billion per annum) and feasible structure 7 as the design with the minimal environmental impact (89,600 m3/year of greenhouse gas emission). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The current paper is about bus transport process network synthesis. Unlike previously discussed urban traffic modelling and solution methods, here, it is presented as a novel application of the p-graph methodology, while exploiting the peculiarities of the problem. The focus is on the synthesis step, where the set of potentially feasible solutions is determined, in other words, the maximal bus transport process structure is generated. The classical process network instances together with their properties are adapted to this new application field, i.e. to meet the special requirements of the bus transport. First, the meaning of the material type nodes and the operating unit type nodes are described in details. A new axiom is given to complete the set of p-graph’s axioms. In addition, the utilization of the conventional maximal structure and solution structure generation algorithms, they are extended to gain advantage of the new axiom and to generate the potential solution structure in a more effective manner. Based on the solution structures a mathematical programming model is generated containing the constraints and the objective function of the bus transport problem. Thus, the generation of the bus launching list is prepared. The solution method presented for bus transport problems meets the high level expectations of decision-makers, i.e. the resulting system is complete, flexible and robust. © 2019, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

AB  - Biomass supply chain has been extended to cope with the growing concern on sustainability development and cleaner production. Process network optimisation is no longer sufficient to improve the biomass product life cycle. A comprehensive and systematic debottlenecking approach is required to identify and subsequently remove the underlying bottlenecks which hinder the biomass industry from attainment of sustainable paradigm. Therefore, this paper introduced a novel debottlenecking approach that incorporates P-graph framework and sustainability index (SI) to address the aforementioned issue. In addition, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to determine the appropriate priority scale for each sustainability dimension, including economic sustainability (annual revenue), environmental sustainability (pollutants emission) and social sustainability (safety aspect). Three different scenarios (palm oil mill effluent (POME) valorisation, oil palm frond (OPF) valorisation and biomass selection for gasification) which obtained from a Malaysia case study, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed debottlenecking method is capable to identify the bottlenecks of the research problem easily and efficiently (i.e., all three scenarios show positive outcome since the satisfaction level of the given technology pathways or biomass option have been gradually improved after debottlenecking). On top of that, the strengths and limitations of the proposed method are also discussed in this paper. This research is expected to be beneficial to the nation's biomass industry in the development of biomass industry. © 2018

AB  - Cogeneration systems provide an efficient means of producing electricity and heat, while trigeneration systems extend the concept by producing an additional output in the form of cooling. Such systems are more efficient than stand-alone production of separate product streams due to the inherent opportunities for Process Integration. Additional advantages include operational flexibility, which can be achieved by varying the outputs of component process units, or switching them on and off selectively as the need arises. Various Process Systems Engineering tools such as Mathematical Programming and P-graph have been used for the synthesis of such plants, most of which work on deterministic assumptions. In this work, a fuzzy P-graph approach is developed for the optimal synthesis of cogeneration and trigeneration systems. This approach assumes that product demand and fuel availability are specified as fuzzy constraints, or fuzzy ranges, instead of exact values. Two case studies are used to illustrate how the fuzzy P-graph method identifies sets of optimal and near-optimal designs that meet the specified fuzzy constraints. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Multi-disruption criticality analysis in bioenergy-based eco-industrial parks via the P-graph approach
AU  - Benjamin, M.F.D.
T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - Bioenergy-based eco-industrial parks or “bioenergy parks” are integrated networks of biomass processing industries that optimally allocate products, by-products, waste, as well as common utilities in order to further improve sustainability. This multifunctional system produces high value products such as power, biochar, biochemicals, etc. alongside with the conventional biofuels (e.g., bioethanol). However, these networks are characterized as inherently vulnerable to cascading disruptions in cases of inoperability (i.e., reduction in production levels) of one or more of its component bioenergy plants. The inoperability of bioenergy plants can be caused by supply-side disruptions due to reductions in the available biomass feedstocks (i.e., caused by climate change-induced events) as well as due to seasonal variations in the demand for bioenergy products. It is therefore essential to incorporate these factors in the systematic risk analysis prior to designing of bioenergy parks. This work thus develops an extension to the P-graph based method for criticality analysis in bioenergy parks considering multiple supply-side and demand-side perturbation scenarios. Results show that the average net output reduction in the bioenergy park is higher for multiple plant disruption scenarios and criticality of bioenergy plants is greatly influenced by variations in product demands. The proposed method can be used in the long-term planning and developing of robust bioenergy parks while considering both uncertainties in the supply and demand. A bioenergy park case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the P-graph based approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can be reduced by closing anthropogenic cycles, and the methanation of carbon dioxide with hydrogen provides a promising option. Nevertheless, the reaction mechanism of this system is under discussion. The proposal of new pathways and the discussion of their feasibility can be structured with the application of P-graphs, to perform a combinatorially complete search of pathways in the first step of a kinetic study. By imposing constraints, the searching algorithm allows to compose feasible pathways. These constraints include mass balances and the existence of known intermediates. The search domain to find feasible pathways in the methanation of carbon dioxide can be reduced with the use of reaction blocks. No feasible pathways are lost in this process. The set of possible mechanisms have been reduced from 31 billion to 71 possible pathways, presented as an option to explain the reaction mechanism in this system. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The design of sustainable manufacturing processes and supply chains is rapidly becoming a critical issue. The reason is the necessity of providing for the needs of a growing human population which is increasingly prosperous across the globe. To this purpose, this review article explores the most important elements of sustainability science and couples them with the P-graph framework, thereby rendering it possible to design feasible process and supply structures with great ease. Structure is an often-overlooked aspect of process and supply chain design, in part because even relative simple processes or supply chains can have an enormous number of feasible structures. We further illustrate the application of these ideas with examples of energy generation processes and supply chains. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 624–636, 2018. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog

AB  - A P-Graph model is developed to address energy supply options of a manufacturing plant. Today's industrial facilities usually have a wide range of options to supply its needs in terms of heat, electricity or water. It is difficult to find the most suitable solution, as several factors must be taken into consideration, including fixed and proportional investment and operational costs, sustainability requirements and variable availability of resources. The P-Graph framework is an effective tool in the synthesis of process networks, which involves the P-Graph modeling tool, rigorous mathematical formulation and algorithms, as well as the utilization of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models. In this work, the energy supply options of an electronic device manufacturing plant are examined. Decisions can be made about the sources of heat and electricity, including buying energy directly from the market or possibly investing into more economic biogas furnaces, a pelletizer, solar cells, with utilization of several different raw materials as energy sources. © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In the developing world, many universities are currently in the midst of transition from being purely teaching institutions focused on educational and degree-granting functions, towards becoming more research-intensive organizations that contribute new knowledge. Such transitions are usually hampered by difficulties associated with resource constraints, excessively bureaucratic support processes, and, most importantly, a staff profile inappropriate to the increased demands of research activities. Thus, systematic approaches for planning human resource expansion in such cases can facilitate such transitions. In this work, a P-graph approach is developed as a decision support model for planning staffing levels in universities that seek to expand research activities. Different staff categories are represented as process units in the P-graph model, while interactions among staff categories are modeled as process streams. This methodology is illustrated with a hypothetical but representative example of a typical Philippine university. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Biochar application to soil is a potentially scalable carbon sequestration strategy. In practice, the amount of biochar that can be added to soil is constrained by the presence of contaminants such as salts, heavy metals, or dioxins. Process Systems Engineering (PSE) and Process Integration (PI) methods can be developed to optimize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in such biochar-based Carbon Management Networks (CMNs). Previous works have proposed Mathematical Programming (MP) and Pinch Analysis (PA) approaches to the planning of these systems but are subject to the inherent methodological limitations. In this work, an alternative approach using Process Graph (P-graph) is developed, based on the source-sink matching problem being treated as a special Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problem. A case study is solved to illustrate the P-graph approach. In particular, optimal and near-optimal solutions are generated for the problem, which in real applications presents improved flexibility for purposes of practical decision support.

AB  - Food, water and domestic energy demands changes seasonally as well as the availability of renewable energy sources. One of the challenging questions of utilizing renewable resources is its synchronization with the periodically varying demands. Only those methods can estimate the economic feasibility, which can explicitly take into account the pairing of demands with potential resources in multiple time horizons as well as the potential storage options. Moreover, waste treatment cannot be neglected in any long-term technology planning procedure. The P-graph framework provides appropriate formal and algorithmic basis for process synthesis, including structural modelling and model validation (Friedler et al., 1992), generation of alternative network structures (Friedler et al., 1995), determination of the optimal and N-best design alternatives (Friedler et al., 1996). By the help of the P-graph framework and its software implementation, i.e., the P-graph Studio developed at the University of Pannonia, process-network synthesis problems can be modelled and solved in general (Bertok et al., 2013), and optimization of multiperiod operation (Heckl et al., 2014), as well as multiperiod system design (Aviso et al., 2016) and waste treatment optimization (Friedler et al., 1994) in particular. Thanks to the built-in algorithm RCABB (Bartos et al., 2015) not just the best, but the list of N-best structurally different alternative network configurations can be generated utilizing the computational power of the computers executing. In the present work, recent additions to the software is to be introduced for multiperiod process-network synthesis including the design of waste treatment system, and computer aid for answering questions about the sensitivity of a configuration to the actual economic environment are to be shown.

AB  - The P-graph framework was originally developed to address Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problems in the preliminary design of chemical plants. P-graph provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for solving PNS problems via the maximal structure generation (MSG), solution structure generation (SSG) and accelerated branch-and-bound (ABB) algorithms. MSG ensures rigorous generation of the maximal structure, while the ad hoc generation of a superstructure as basis for a mathematical programming model can lead to significant modelling errors. In addition, SSG allows the generation of combinatorially feasible network structures that can be utilized for practical decision-making by designers. For very large problems, ABB can reduce the computational effort of reaching globally optimal solutions by multiple orders of magnitude compared to conventional branch-and-bound solvers for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. In addition to conventional PNS problems, P-graph has been applied to the optimization of separation processes, Heat Exchanger Networks (HENs), Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, chemical reaction pathways, polygeneration plants, biorefineries, and supply chains. Further non-conventional applications have also been reported, such as the optimisation of office processes, human resource networks, and economic structures at the level of cities or regions. In addition to synthesis and design problems, P-graph has also been applied to operational problems, such as determining the best abnormal operating conditions for process networks. These diverse applications suggest the potential for applying the P-graph framework as a problem-solving strategy for a broad class of generalized process networks, beyond the traditional PNS problems in chemical plant design. This paper surveys recent trends in the P-graph literature and uses bibliometric analysis to identify promising trends and discusses potential directions for novel applications for optimization of generalized process networks, particularly for applications that address critical sustainability issues.

AB  - Lignocellulosic waste is one of the most abundant and potential feedstocks for anaerobic digestion (AD), but the energy efficiency is limited by the lignocellulosic composition which is recalcitrant to biodegradation. Pretreatment of feedstock and the post-treatment of biogas and digestate play a significant role in enhancing the AD efficiency as well as the product utilisation. This study aims to determine the cost-optimal pre-and post-treatment pathway for an AD of lignocellulosic waste by applying P-graph. The economic balance between the main operating cost, yield and quality of products were considered. The treatment options were overviewed followed by a case study considered a different combination of physical, chemical and biological pretreatments, biogas post-treatment (combine heat and power, fuel cell, biomethane, biofuel) and digestate treatments. A total of 9 pre-treatments for lignocellulosic waste, 2 digestate post-treatments and 9 post-treatments for biogas were evaluated in this study. Chemical pre-treatment by CaO, post-treatment by H2S removal with membrane separation for biomethane production and without the composting of digestate is suggested as the optimal treatment pathway for lignocellulosic waste.

AB  - This paper explores the macro optimisation decisions of energy sources selection and the structural design of the utility system within the framework of Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI). Most TSHI research on utility systems focuses on optimisation of conventional Combined Heat and Power systems. To build a new Utility Systems Planner (USP) tool, P-graph has been selected as the optimisation tool. A critical element of USP is the inclusion of low-grade heat utilisation technologies within the considered superstructure. The USP outputs include the optimal structure of the utility system including the arrangement and size of each component and estimates for Greenhouse Gas and Water Footprints. The successful application of the USP to a representative industrial case study with district energy integration shows an optimal solution with a natural gas boiler, reciprocating gas engine, condensing economiser, steam turbine, thermocompressor, organic Rankine cycle, cooling tower, and electric chiller with a total cost of 14.893 M€/y. The new tool is a platform for launching further research including site-specific application, multi-period optimisation, and sensitivity analysis. Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a novel method to visualise and solve Total Site Mass, Heat and Power Integration problem using a combination of Process Integration and P-graph techniques. Previous methods dealing with mass, heat and power integration are based on Mathematical Programming, which has the disadvantage of lacking adequate visualisation tools during the construction and optimisation of the problem. It also can face computational issues as problems become increasingly complex. The new method incorporates three important process engineering tools: (1) process modelling of mass and energy balance, (2) Pinch Analysis of individual processes and Total Site Heat Integration of clusters of related processes, and (3) the construction of a Total Site superstructure within the P-graph framework to represent the possible mass, heat, and power interconnections between process and utility systems. To demonstrate the method, a biorefinery case study is investigated. The basis for the biorefinery is a Kraft pulp mill in combination with three potential processes, combined heat and power, and geothermal steam. The three considered new processes are gasification for dimethyl-ether production, simultaneous scarification and co-fermentation of pine for ethanol production, and hydrothermal liquefaction for bio-oil production. Results from the case study show the current optimal solution as a Kraft mill with geothermal heat achieving a profit (revenue less energy and capital costs) of NZD $283 M/y. A near-optimal solution has hydrothermal liquefaction added to the Kraft mill with geothermal heat with a profit of NZD $252 M/y. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A P-graph and Monte Carlo simulation approach to planning carbon management networks is proposed. These networks are generalized systems for minimizing emissions of CO2. Application of the P-graph framework to such problems has the added advantage of being able to rigorously identify both optimal and near-optimal solutions, which is a feature that is useful for practical decision-making; Monte Carlo simulation can then be used to evaluate the robustness of a network to variations in system parameters. Two literature case studies are used to demonstrate this methodology. The first example is a carbon-constrained energy sector planning problem, while the second example is a CO2 capture and storage planning problem. In both cases, it is demonstrated that multiple solutions generated using P-graph methodology allow identification of robust, near-optimal carbon management networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A P-graph model was recently developed for direct reuse/recycle scheme for both in-plant resource conservation networks (RCNs) and inter-plant RCNs (IPRCNs). The proposed P-graph model allows visualization which expedites the assessment of optimal and near-optimal solutions. In this paper, the P-graph model will be extended to material interception schemes, i.e., material regeneration and pre-treatment. Material regeneration involves the use of purification unit for quality improvement of the process sources before they are reused/recycled to the sinks. Pre-treatment processes, on the other hand, involve the purification of fresh resources for use in processes with stringent quality requirement. Two literature case studies are solved to demonstrate the newly extended model. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Deployment of efficient, integrated energy systems can make a substantial contribution to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Such systems are suitable for the provision of distributed energy supply in remote areas, and offer the advantages of compactness and operational flexibility. Also, the simultaneous production of multiple products provides the opportunity for Process Integration, thus leading to improved fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. Process Systems Engineering methods can be applied for the synthesis of such sustainable energy systems. For example, process graph (or P-graph) models have previously been developed for synthesizing single-period polygeneration systems based on the Process Network Synthesis framework. In this work, a P-graph model for multi-period optimization of sustainable energy systems is developed. The model is able to synthesize flexible systems that can cope with changes in the availability of raw material supply and variations in product demand. In addition, the P-graph model is also capable of generating near-optimal solutions, which provide insights that may be significant to decision-makers, such as structural features that are common to a range of good solutions. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the approach developed in this work. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ammonia is a potential low-carbon alternative automotive fuel. However, it is produced commercially via the energy- and greenhouse gas-intensive Haber-Bosch process, and its nitrogen footprint may also detract from its environmental benefits. Thus, whether its use as an automotive fuel is sustainable from a life-cycle standpoint remains in question. In this study, a P-graph model is developed to determine the best well-to-wheel pathway for the use of ammonia as an automotive fuel, using carbon and nitrogen footprints as dual environmental criteria. Multiple fossil fuel-based and biomass-based ammonia production processes are considered, as well as different drivetrain configurations that include internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) and fuel cell vehicles (FCV). In the case of ICEV, the model also considers the secondary fuels needed to allow ammonia use in existing engines. Solving the P-graph model identifies the optimal pathway as cyanobacteria-based ammonia production coupled with FCV. This pathway has a carbon footprint of 4.96 g CO2 equiv/km and a nitrogen footprint of 0.325 g reactive N/km. The model also identifies a cluster of near-optimal solutions, for which possible technology improvements are discussed. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of integrated bioenergy systems (IBS) is a prospective solution to address the emergent global demand for clean energy. The sustainability of IBS compared to stand-alone biomass processing facilities is achieved through integration of process units or component plants via their bioenergy products, by-products, wastes, and common utilities. However, such increased component interdependency makes the resulting integrated energy system vulnerable to capacity disruptions. IBS in particular are vulnerable to climate change-induced events (e.g., drought) that reduce the availability of biomass feedstocks in bioenergy production. Cascading failure due to such supply-side disruptive event is an inherent risk in IBS and may pose a barrier to the commercial-scale adoption of such systems. A previous study developed a risk-based criticality index to quantify the effect of a component’s disruption within integrated energy systems. This index is used to rank the component’s relative risk in the network based on the ripple effects of its disruption. In this work, a novel P-graph approach is proposed as an alternative methodology for criticality analysis of component units or plants in an IBS. This risk-based metric can be used for developing risk management polices to protect critical facilities, thereby increasing the robustness of IBS against disruptions. Two case studies on determining the criticality index of process units in an integrated biorefinery and component plants in a bioenergy park are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - P-graph methodology was originally proposed as a systematic approach to process network synthesis (PNS). However, this graph theoretic approach has also been applied to a broad range of problems with similar structure as PNS. In particular, recent work has demonstrated the similarity of PNS problems to input-output (IO) optimization problems; the latter class of problems has been applied for physical flows at scales ranging from process plant level to supply chain level. IO models have also been proposed to plan the allocation of human resource in organizations. In this work, a P-graph based approach to reallocation of human resources in an industrial plant during a transient crisis is presented. The model determines how personnel can be reassigned to allow a plant to operate at an alternative temporary steady state when the plant becomes short-handed due to a disruptive external event. This methodology is demonstrated using a representative case study involving an instant coffee plant. Results show that in the occasion that a reduction in available workforce is experienced, workforce is allocated in more critical areas and productivity is maximized by minimizing interaction with less critical departments. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Sustainable Supply Chain Design by the P-graph Framework: Methodology and Strategy
AU  - Cabezas, H.
T2  - Encycl. of Sustain. Technol.
AB  - This article discusses the design of sustainable supply chains, especially their structure, by the use of the P-graph framework and sustainability concepts. This is important because much of modern commerce and manufacturing is mediated by supply chains, making their sustainability a critical issue. In addition, the properties of supply chains are often determined by their structure, which the P-graph framework can manage efficiently. The text also presents a review of the concept of sustainability, including a practical working definition, and a discussion of methods for assessing sustainability. These ideas are illustrated with the design and sustainability assessment of energy supply chains and consumer product supply chains. Finally, the strategy for assessing and making multifaceted sustainability decisions is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for climate change adaptation in industry has led to intensified research in industrial resource conservation, as well as waste reduction, to enable sustainable operations to be achieved even under conditions of declining water resources. Such sustainability initiatives can be facilitated using the systematic approach of process integration (PI). Of particular interest are resource conservation network (RCN) problems, which have been solved using pinch analysis or mathematical programming methods. On the other hand, other process system engineering (PSE) tools such as the process graph (or P-graph) framework offers potential alternative approaches to RCN problems. To date, P-graph methodology has been used for various process network synthesis (PNS) problems; however, no RCN synthesis applications have been reported thus far. This paper presents a novel implementation of P-graph for RCN synthesis. In addition to the inherent computational efficiency of its algorithms, P-graph allows the elucidation of optimal and near-optimal solutions, a feature which is potentially useful for practical decision-making. Capital and operating cost considerations can be incorporated easily. In this paper, direct reuse/recycle scheme is applied for in-plant RCN and inter-plant RCN (IPRCN). © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.

AB  - The onset of climate change is expected to bring about more severe weather patterns which may lead to floods, drought, and even the outbreak of new types of diseases. These can potentially disrupt the operations of industries and firms as infrastructure can be damaged and the availability of resources and workforce are compromised. It is thus important to develop models which will assist in the efficient management of resources during times of crisis. Process systems engineering techniques have previously been used for the design and optimization of complex systems during crisis conditions. This work presents the development of a P-graph model for the optimal allocation of human resources within a firm when the available workforce has been limited due to a climate change-induced crisis. The model identifies an optimal strategy for maximizing firm productivity by prioritizing highly critical areas. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.

AB  - Polygeneration systems have been utilized to simultaneously generate a number of energy and utility products such as heat, power, cooling and treated water. Its implementation has proven to increase fuel efficiency and to reduce the associated carbon footprint in products in comparison to stand-alone production systems. The polygeneration system consists of interdependent process units whose design capacities will depend on the expected product demands. Because of the multiple product streams generated and the associated demands, it is necessary to design a system which aims to simultaneously meet potentially conflicting product demand targets. Fuzzy optimization has initially been used to identify the optimal solution which simultaneously satisfices multiple product demand targets. However, real life decision-making may require an evaluation of alternative solutions. This aspect can be addressed by the P-graph methodology which is able to provide both optimal and sub-optimal network designs. This work thus proposes the development of a fuzzy P-graph model for the design of a polygeneration system. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated in a case study. The model results identify both optimal and sub-optimal design options which generate products within the defined demand targets and which can be further evaluated for other parameters such as robustness for final decision-making.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to solve total site heat and mass integration and optimisation using P-graph framework, with a biorefinery case study. Total site heat and mass integration is important for the selection of biorefinery processes because it must achieve high material and energy efficiency to be economically competitive. This paper considers co-location of simultaneous scarification and co-fermentation of wood, hydrothermal liquefaction of forest residues and gasification of black liquor with an existing Kraft pulp mill in Central North Island of New Zealand. Result shows that the Kraft pulp mill is the most profitable biorefinery option, followed by hydrothermal liquefaction. However, an increment in the price of bio-oil by 5 % puts hydrothermal liquefaction in the optimal network with Kraft pulp mill. © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The P-graph framework is a combinatorial approach to synthesising and optimising process networks. It is very efficient in handling problems with high combinatorial complexity and has shown great superiority in reducing the related computational burden. Over the years, it has proven its efficiency in solving topologically and combinatorically challenging problems. Many successful applications to scientific and real-life problems have been produced, demonstrating the benefit potential. The application areas range from the initial chemical process synthesis to identifying the mechanisms of chemical and biochemical reactions, supply chains optimisation, regional resource planning, crisis management, evacuation planning and business process modelling. There have been tools of several generations implementing the P-graph framework, with a simple user interface, but featuring serious data input requirement. The P-graph framework also allows sensitivity analysis and produces usually a set of recommended solutions as opposed to the usual single output from straight applications of MP. The current contribution makes a critical overview of the achievements from applying the P-graph framework and the main issues to be dealt with. Based on that, a set of recommendations is made on the necessary future development of the implementations regarding modelling capability, data and algorithmic interfaces, representation of the modelled networks, as well as complexity management.

TI  - P-graph approach to criticality analysis in bioenergy parks under uncertainty
AU  - Benjamin, M.F.D.
T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - A bioenergy park is an integrated network of biomass processing industries that optimally allocate products, byproducts, wastes, and utilities in order to improve sustainability. However, such systems are also characterized as having inherent vulnerability to cascading disruptions due to inoperability (i.e., capacity reduction) of one or more of its component plants. The inoperability of bioenergy plants can be caused by supply-side disruptions due to reductions in the available biomass feedstocks. It is therefore necessary to incorporate risk analysis when designing bioenergy parks. A previous study developed a risk-based criticality analysis in integrated bioenergy systems (IBS) based on P-graph methodology. This approach utilizes the algorithmic capabilities of the P-graph framework in order to identify critical facilities in an IBS. However, uncertainties in the demand for bioenergy products are not yet considered in the framework. This work thus proposes an extension to the P-graph based method for criticality analysis in bioenergy parks with demand perturbation scenarios. The method can be used in long-term planning and developing robust bioenergy parks. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Minimising the demand for fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas footprints is of high priority for sustainable development. This is true for all societal aspects - including research and development. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) networks are regarded as one of the potential contributors to solving this problem by applying a win-win strategy for simultaneously minimising the landfilled waste, fossil fuel demand and the associated footprints. A critical aspect for the success of a Waste-to-Energy network is to account for the spatial challenges posed by the distributed nature of the waste generation and the energy demands, where the size of the processing facilities and the served areas should be simultaneously optimised. The current work proposes concepts and procedure for targeting these capacities and sizes as the first step in the WtE network synthesis, employing Process Integration and P-graph. An illustrative case study is provided, illustrating the procedure and its application. Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Problem-based Learning (PBL) is regarded by many education experts as superior to the traditional lecture, particularly for learning higher-order skills and concepts. PBL can be further reinforced through the utilization of metacognitive skills on the part of the students. Such approaches are particularly useful in Process Systems Engineering (PSE) and Process Integration (PI), where proficiency in the use of methodologies for problem-solving is paramount. In this paper, we describe how such educational strategies can be used to improve learning outcomes through the use of the process graph (P-graph) framework for the synthesis of polygeneration systems, in addition to conventional approaches using lectures and drills. Practical pedagogic implications are then discussed for potential use in teaching related topics in PSE/PI. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to the increasing complexity of human developed systems computer aid plays key role in engineering design involving process synthesis and analysis. The P-graph framework provides effective algorithms implemented in software to synthesize optimal process systems constructed from potential building blocks leading from the available resources to the desired targets. P-graph software computes both the optimal structure and the optimal parameter values of a process system, however, does not provide information on the dynamics of the system synthesized. In contrast Petri nets are tools for simulation and analysis of complex systems’ dynamic behavior. They can model the operation of a preliminarily well-defined process network, but they are inappropriate for synthesizing the optimal process structure. The present work suggests joint application of the methods mentioned above combining effective synthesis algorithms from the P-graph framework with the modeling strength of Petri nets, illustrated by identification of feasible reaction pathways. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Several formalisms and techniques have been introduced in the literature for the purpose of modeling and evaluation of complex systems. Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses, which also depend on the purpose of the evaluation. In this paper we propose the integration of two different formalisms in a single framework for the modeling, validation, and optimization of production-supply problems. In particular, the proposed framework combines Process Graphs (P-Graphs) as the modeling formalism, and Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) for the analysis and optimization. The integration proposed in this paper extends the capabilities of the P-Graph formalism to include performance and dependability metrics in the optimization process, without hampering the modeling convenience of P-Graphs. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of the optimization of a power supply network. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The process graph (P-graph) framework was introduced in the early 1990s as a graph theoretic approach to Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problems in chemical engineering. This framework has several advantageous features, such as mathematically rigorous generation of maximal structures (i.e., superstructures), elucidation of combinatorially feasible solution structures, and efficient search of solution space for optimal PNS compared to conventional branch-and-bound algorithms for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. In the three decades since its inception, the P-graph framework has proven to be a viable approach to a wide array of PNS and other structurally analogous problems; the methodology has also matured, as evidenced by the development of key software tools (PNS Draw, PNS Studio and P-graph Studio) and its appearance in modern textbooks. Nevertheless, the P-graph framework has yet to achieve broad, mainstream penetration among grassroots chemical engineering users, especially those without a strong mathematical programming background. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of instructional P-graph modules in undergraduate chemical engineering degree programs at the University of Nottingham, Malaysia Campus and De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines. These modules have primarily focused on the design of Green Processes. Results show that the visual nature of the P-graph methodology is an advantage for practical engineering decision-making, and that it complements the learning of mainstream techniques such as mathematical programming. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With upsizing, complexifying and unifying in modern petro-chemical systems, the combined complexity among streams of mass, energy and information as well as among unit operations keeps increasing exponentially. P-graph theory has found widespread applications by generation of rigorous superstructures as a result of axiom constraints which may reduce creation of redundant structures. This review on P-graph theory began with the mathematical definition, fundamental axioms, solution algorithms and workflow, and a case study to show the modeling framework and graphic representation. A literature study of past 20 years' publications systemically summarized application of P-graph theory in traditional process system engineering of separation network synthesis, reaction path synthesis and heat exchange synthesis, and recent expansion in new areas of process technology selection, supply chain and process optimization. The advantages and disadvantages of P-graph theory and mathematical programming were compared, and improving ideas were proposed to solve nonlinear problems with P-graph theory. The prospective research and application of P-graph theory were forecasted, including multi-objective optimization in consideration of economic and environmental factors, effective solution of large complex nonlinear programming problems by the combination of both P-graph and mathematical programming, and other potential applications. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - The increase of the global population has a negative impact to the environment due to the direct correlation between the amount of solid waste generated and the population growth. In order to create a more sustainable future, an adequate waste management system is necessary. Utilisation of biomass that have potential to be converted into various forms of valuable products (i.e. energy, biochemical and value-added products) is a promising way to deal with the increasing amount of agriculture residues. Therefore, it is suggested to develop a multi-biomass corridor in order to promote a global sustainable development of renewable energy. However, this large-scale problem normally consists of a huge number of variables (large set of possible locations of processing hub, large set of operating units and large set of material involved). This will lead to a longer computational duration due to the high complexity of the network. In order to address this issue, a novel "Decomposition Approach" which integrates P-graph framework and conventional mathematical modelling is proposed in this paper. The presented approach is demonstrated via an actual case study in Johor. In this paper, the correlated cost function for the four main biomass in Johor (i.e. palm oil biomass, sugarcane bagasse, pineapple residue and paddy biomass) is formulated. On top of that, a multiple biomass supply chain which integrates three underutilised biomass into the palm oil biomass supply chain in Johor is synthesised successfully and efficiently as well. The result shows that about 82% of the overall variables in this case study are removed from the model after applying the proposed approach, causing a 50% reduction in the computational time. This indicates that the proposed approach is useful for real-world applications. However, regular revision on the model is recommended in order to assure the reliability of the result. In addition, this paper also outlines several potential extension works that can be conducted in future. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A computer-aided methodology for process synthesis is introduced here by utilizing the P-graph (process graph) framework. A process system or network endeavors to create certain products from raw materials using a number of processing steps. Process synthesis determines the structure of a process system. Examples of said networks range from food processing plants through chemical production to energy production networks. The P-graph methodology is a graph-theoretical approach utilized for solving process network synthesis problems. The P-graphs are bipartite graphs, each comprising nodes for a set of materials, a set of operating units, and arcs linking them. The P-graph framework provides a mathematically rigorous procedure for synthesizing optimal and alternative suboptimal networks subject to constraints, which may include profitability and sustainability in the proposed methodology. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The P-graph framework introduced by Friedler et al. (Chem Eng Sci. 1992;47:1973-1988) is a general mathematical methodology based on Graph Theory which is applicable to many process design problems. We propose an extension of the P-graph framework and the associated MILP model to account for operating units and systems where the inputs and outputs are variable. This is important because the P-graph framework in its current form would otherwise apply only to systems where the ratios of inputs to outputs are fixed. Consequently, it is difficult to apply the method to many emerging systems without the new mathematical model presented here. We discuss and develop the model in detail, and we then illustrate its application with the case study of an energy system. We establish a structure with optimal cost for a baseline heat demand, and we further explore how the energy system structure and the feedstocks change as the heat demand increases. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Industrial complexes allow for efficient and sustainable production of various goods, but at the same time they are also vulnerable to cascading failures caused by disruptions in process capacity or resource availability. Climate change in particular may cause significant perturbations in the supply of important process inputs such as water, energy, or feedstocks. Thus, for industrial complexes, proper risk management strategies must be developed as part of overall climate change adaptation and resilience measures. Rigorous modeling approaches are needed to ensure that economic losses resulting from a disruption are minimized. In this paper, a P-graph-based methodology is used to determine optimal adjustments to crisis conditions in order to minimize manufacturing losses; this graph theoretic methodology has traditionally been used for process network synthesis problems but has recently proven to be useful for structurally analogous problem domains. Two case studies on the reallocation of production capacities and product streams in an aluminum production complex and a biomass processing complex are used to illustrate the methodology. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - It is anticipated that demand for chemicals and fuel derived from sustainably grown bio-mass will increase over the coming decades. Forest and wood processing residues and waste are likely to become a significant feedstock to large scale biorefineries to produce both renewable fuels and chemicals. Maximising the economic value of these residues whilst simultaneously minimising the environmental impact of the manufactured product is an important task in process and product selection and design. Multiple processing and product pathways exist and it is often unclear what the best options are without detailed assessment or preliminary design. The P-graph framework was used to examine the economically feasibility of utilising five types of wood processing residues: wood chip, pulp logs, saw dust, and landing and cutover residues. Twenty different products were considered, based on three main production platforms or routes, sugars, pyrolysis, and gasification. Kraft pulp production and energy products were also considered as viable options for residues. Only six of the products considered were found to be profitable with the most economically viable uses being kraft pulp production and boiler fuel. Products included in the feasible solutions and the source of residues are all finely balanced, and slight changes in feedstock cost, product price, and operational and capital costs can cause major changes to the feasible structures. When heat integration for using Total Site was incorporated into the P-graph there was no economic benefit for the routes and scale of production considered here. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Reliable isolated energy systems are necessary for supplying energy to remote areas where grid extension is not feasible. It may also be required to harness renewable energy to reduce the use of conventional fuel that involves potentially high transportation cost and carbon emissions. Polygeneration systems are suitable for distributed energy supply in remote areas with the advantages of compactness and operational flexibility. Also, the simultaneous production of multiple utilities and products provides the opportunity for process integration, hence increased fuel efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. The challenge is to identify the optimal design of the processes such that the system remains in operation regardless of anticipated changes in raw material supply and product demand during multi-period operations. Graph theoretic models in the form of a P-graph (process graph) have previously been developed for synthesizing single period polygeneration systems. This work aims to develop a P-graph model to handle multi-period operations of isolated energy systems. The resulting network is thus more robust since it is able to operate amidst changes in the availability of raw material supply and/or variations in product demand. In addition, the P-graph model is also capable of generating near-optimal solutions which provide insights into other intangible parameters that may be significant to decision-makers. A case study will be presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - P-graph employs combinatorial and optimisation algorithms to solve process network synthesis (PNS) problem. However, the P-graph framework requires linear cost functions when optimising PNS problems. As a result, a high error between the user-input linear cost function and the actual non-linear cost function is likely to occur. This paper presents a new method to incorporate multiple linear cost functions in parallel for raw materials, operating units and products in P-graph problems to accurately approximate the non-linear functional form of most cost estimation functions. This was achieved by dividing the original cost functions into multiple equal segments that then could be individually represented by linear sub-functions. Application of the new method to a simple wood-to-fuel processing example influences the optimal P-graph process structure such that a previously uneconomic side-product route (pyrolysis) becomes economic and increases the overall profit. The results also demonstrate that the linear approximation error decreases with increasing numbers of segments and linear cost sub-functions. The time increase to solve the new problem structure, which has over threefold more operating units, is negligible for this simple case, but may be significant for more complex problems.

AB  - The adoption of bioenergy parks is a prospective solution to increase the sustainability of stand-alone biomass processing plants. Production and resource efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and economic sustainability are achieved by synergistic exchanges of material and energy resources between components plants. However, such increased plant interdependency and the resulting integrated energy system is vulnerable to capacity disruptions. Cascading failure due to such disruptive event is an inherent risk in bioenergy parks and may pose as a barrier in implementing such system. The extent of risk originating from disrupted critical component plants in the network exhibited to be higher. A previous study developed a novel risk-based criticality index, based on input-output models, to quantify the effect of a component plant's disruption within a bioenergy park. This index is used to rank the plant's relative risk in the network based on its disruption consequence. In this work, a P-graph approach is proposed as an alternative methodology for criticality analysis of component plants in a bioenergy park. The P-graph framework is initially developed for solving process network synthesis, but recently being used to solve similarly structured problems. This risk-based metric can also be used for developing risk management measures to protect critical infrastructures, thereby increasing the robustness of bioenergy parks against disruptions. A case study is then presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Inoperability input-output modeling (IIM) was introduced as a methodology for determining ripple effects propagating through interdependent infrastructure systems as a result of disruptive events such as natural disasters. It is based on the dimensionless metric of inoperability which indicates degree of failure along a scale ranging from 0 to 1. Previous approaches have focused on calibration of interdependencies based on records of economic statistics; IIM has also been used mainly for identifying the vulnerability and criticality of system components. More recent work has demonstrated that the IIM framework can be the basis for optimal allocation of inoperabiltiy in order to minimize damage caused by disruptions. In this work, we propose a P-graph methodology derived from IIM. Interdependency coefficients are integrated within a P-graph model to enable limited capacity of infrastructure following a disruption to be optimally allocated. We demonstrate this methodology using a literature case study. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - Establishment of biomass supply chain is preliminary stage for biomass energy production especially in proposing potential processing plant location. Most of the relevant biomass is produced in abundance in agriculture sector. In Malaysia, biomass supply is obtained mainly from oil palm plantation which governed under Federal Land Development Authority. Biomass supply chain deals with harvesting, storage, pretreatment and transportation. Low energy density of biomass combined with availability of biomass that is widely distributed contributes huge constraints to the problem. To address this issue, P-graph modelling is used as the methodology to solve combinatorial complexity of the biomass supply chain in Federal Land Development Authority Jengka. Few possible locations for building new biomass processing plant and storage hubs were introduced in the optimisation problem. Existing plant mills, hubs and possible plant locations were interconnected to create a network. Fuel consumption for transportation was calculated by taking into account the road profiles of the routes in Jengka. The resulting solution from Accelerated Branch and Bound algorithm in P-graph shows that the optimal solution is through building new plant in location 1, 2 and 4 for a profit of 77.35 M MYR/y (18.3 M €/y).

AB  - Benzaldehyde is a chemical of significant importance in a variety of industries, which is mainly manufactured from toluene. In this work, authors develop process flowsheets in terms of profit for the production of benzaldehyde from toluene via process-network synthesis by deploying an algorithmic method based on P-graphs. First, the best reaction combination for the production process in terms of profit is obtained. Second, a set of operating units that can perform the process is identified; the corresponding maximal structure is constructed with the P-graph representations of these operating units. Third, the optimal and near-optimal flowsheets in terms of profit are algorithmically identified from the maximal structure. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - The P-graph or process graph framework is both a representation and a methodology that can be shown to be extremely useful as a modelling tool in various areas. P-graphs are directed bi-partite graphs that give an unambiguous representation of any process that can be expressed as a network. It is based on rigorous axioms and combinatorial analysis. The result is a maximal structure, solution structures, and an optimal structure of the network for the process of interest. All of these are feasible and meet design requirements. There is freely available software which automates much of the application of the methodology. The P-graph framework is most useful in the initial design phase of a process where the requirements, the feedstocks, the outputs, and the necessary process structure or network may not be precisely defined, but there is a need to generate alternatives which are feasible to start the design process. For this reason, we propose the P-graph framework as an effective means of generating alternative networks which can represent the nexus of energy, water, and food for the purpose of looking for the most cost effective and sustainable options.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis (IS) intends to reduce the consumption of resources as well as reduce the generation of waste streams through utilising by-products of other firms as raw materials of another firm. Mathematical optimisation models have been developed for identifying the optimal design of by-product exchange and utilisation to maximise the benefits of IS networks. However, these models are unable to provide alternative network structures which may have other desirable qualities such as a simpler design, but may be sub-optimal in their realisation of the objective function. Process graph (P-graph) theory is an alternative approach based on graph theory for optimising networks. It has been primarily used for the design and optimisation of process networks, but may be applied to structurally analogous systems. This work thus proposes the development of a P-graph approach for the optimization of IS networks. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study involving a combination of retrofit and grassroots design scenarios, representing existing as well as new plants within an eco-industrial park. The P-graph model is able to provide a graphical representation of the optimal IS system, as well as alternative near-optimal network designs. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to the planning of bioenergy supply chains, taking into account both total cost minimisation and supply chain risk reduction via Process graph (P-graph). The supply chain risk is accounted for in terms of transportation fatalities computed in an actuarial manner. An illustrative example based on Malaysian palm-based bioenergy supply chain is solved to illustrate the proposed approach. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - P-graph is a combinatorial optimisation framework aimed at optimising process networks. It is particularly efficient in handling problems with high combinatorial complexity and it has shown great reduction in the computational burden related to that. The current contribution provides a critical review of the P-graph framework, its fundamentals, main application areas and influence on the scientific and engineering thoughts for solving complicated real-life problems. This is followed by an analysis of the achieved impact, results and limitations. Potential opportunities for future research, development and innovation, opened by the identified limitations, are then suggested and discussed. Copyright © 2015, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.,.

AB  - We present a computer-aided methodology for designing sustainable supply chains using the P-graph framework to develop supply chain structures which are then analyzed using cost, the cost of producing electricity, and two sustainability metrics: the ecological footprint and the emergy input. These metrics respectively represent environmental burden in terms of land use and energy resources. The results are the continuation of a research effort between members of the Office of Research and Development (ORD) of the U.S. EPA and the University of Pannonia. In earlier work, the basis of the research, the integration of supply chain design and sustainability were presented. There, the P-graph framework provided a mathematically rigorous procedure for synthesizing optimal and alternative suboptimal networks subject to profitability and ecological footprint criteria. In this work the effort is extended with another sustainability metric, emergy. Emergy, a measure of the energy used up in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or maintain a service, was assessed for each energy production supply chain. The proposed methodology demonstrates the optimal design of a supply chain which provides electric power and heat to an agricultural region with agricultural wastes that can potentially be recovered as renewable resources. The results of the study indicate that, compared to using electricity from the grid and/or natural gas, renewable energy resources can yield substantial cost reductions of up to 17%, as well as significant ecological footprint and emergy reductions. These results indicate that it is possible to design more sustainable supply chains that are also cost-effective. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change impacts may manifest via multiple pathways, often leading to a shortage of resources, reduction in production capacities, or reduction in available labor inputs that are vital for economic activities. Effective climate change adaptation strategies are needed to determine the optimal allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital under crisis conditions to minimize the economic consequences. In such cases, it is necessary to account for structural properties of economic systems to ensure that rational distribution policies are implemented. Input-output models are used to illustrate interdependencies among economic sectors and to assess both direct and indirect effects of disruptive events. Alternatively, these interdependencies may be exploited for developing effective recovery efforts to minimize the ripple effects of a crisis. In this paper, a process graph representation of the input-output model is developed to generate a rational procedure for the allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital during crisis conditions. The process graph model is a graph-theoretic approach originally developed for chemical process design applications. The analogous problem structure allows it to be used for the input-output system. The method is demonstrated through several case studies to identify allocation policies geared towards reducing the impact of disruptions attributed to critical resources, commodities, or capital. Results show that depending on the economic structure, the optimal allocation of scarce resources, commodities or capital will satisfy the final demands of some economic sectors and reduce the production capacity of others in order to minimize the reduction of total gross domestic product. Though similar results can be obtained through traditional mathematical programming models, the process graph platform has the advantage to visually present the distribution of scarce resources, commodities or capital within the system. This work is a first attempt to implement the process graph approach in the fields of economics and climate change adaptation. In conclusion, the process graph based approach developed in this work can be used to provide policymakers with insights in developing appropriate risk mitigation plans associated with climate change-induced crisis conditions. Potential applications include both the development of disaster preparedness measures for anticipated disruptions, as well as the implementation of real-time emergency response in the midst of a crisis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The P-graph (process graph) framework is an effective tool for process-network synthesis (PNS). Here we extended it to multi-period operations. The efficacy of the P-graph methodology has been demonstrated by numerous applications. The unambiguous representation of processes and the availability of the axioms defining combinatorially feasible structures facilitates the development of efficient algorithms to determine maximal structures, solution structures, and optimal structure for processes. However, it is presumed that single-period operation prevails. It implies that the operating conditions and the load of each operating unit remain unchanged, i.e., steady-state operation. This is usually true for the chemical industry but often not in agriculture or where seasonal effects are important. The current work proposes a multi-period operation wherein the load of operating units varies from period to period to accommodate demand, assuming operating conditions remain steady in each period. A modeling technique is proposed to represent operating units in the multi-period operation. The different periods are connected by “fictitious” streams, which ensures, that the unit is sized properly. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of the P-graph (process graph) framework together with sustainability and profitability considerations for the design of supply chains is discussed. A P-graph contains two types of nodes, nodes for materials (Ms) and nodes for operating units (Os). The lines between the nodes signify that a material is input to or output from an operating unit. The input and output materials are consumed or produced according to the rates stated on the lines leading to and from the respective operating unit. The P-graph methodology cannot be successful without powerful software tools to model, draw, and solve PNS problems. While networks for small problems can be constructed manually, doing so for a moderate-sized problem is a time-consuming and error-prone undertaking. PNS Studio was created to address these issues and assist in building a problem from scratch or modifying an existing model. PNS Studio users do not have to deal with errors such as mistyping the name of an input material accidentally deleting a material that is used by an operating unit. Within the P-graph methodology, the cost of a network is the sum of the costs of the materials and the costs of the operating units.

AB  - In the production of chemicals from fermentation, the cost of downstream purification constitutes the major portion of the total production cost. Since the bioprocess generally contains a large amount of biochemical separation units, its flowsheets are complex. How to generate the rigorous superstructure of the downstream bioprocess is a primary problem and key step. In this work, a robust combined approach based on the P-graph was proposed to generate the rigorous superstructure of the downstream process of fermentation. This method integrates the hierarchical decomposition of the heuristics with P-graph-based algorithm MSG with the advantages including: (1) Different design flowsheets could be evaluated simultaneously; (2) An unique bipartite graph, P-graph, was introduced, which could represent the maximum structure clearly and intuitively; (3) The rigorous superstructure could be automatically generated. The validity of the present method was verified with two practical bioprocesses. Results show that the effective processes and the adequate operation units could be determined in the beginning stage of the design, and the tedious reforming steps during process synthesis could be avoided. © 2015, Assoc.

AB  - At the outset, the design of an organization-based multiagent system is modeled according to the framework of Organization Model for Adaptive Complex Systems (OMACS). Subsequently, this design model is transformed into a process-network model. Eventually, the resultant process-network model in conjunction with the P-graph-based methodology give rise to: (i) the maximal structure of the process network, comprising all the feasible combinations of structures, i.e., OMACS-based design configurations, capable of yielding the specified products from the specified raw material; (ii) every feasible structure for the process of interest; and (iii) the optimal structure of the network, i.e., the optimal OMACS-based design configuration. Finally, in light of the tenet of a modeling- transformation-evaluation paradigm, an appraisal is made of the feasibility as well as the flexibility and cost of the optimal OMACS-based design configuration obtained. © 2015 Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

AB  - Polygeneration plants are inherently more efficient, and generate reduced emissions, in comparison to equivalent stand-alone production systems. These benefits arise from process integration opportunities within the plant. However, such integration also creates interdependencies among process units, which may lead to cascading failures in the event of partial or complete inoperability of key system components. In such cases, the major operational concern is to maximize operating profits (or minimize losses relative to the baseline state) by reallocating process streams; process units may be run at partial load or shut down completely, as needed. In previous work, it has been proposed to determine the optimal operational adjustments using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In this note, we propose an alternative methodology for determining the optimal adjustments based on P-graphs, and demonstrate it using a case study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we study the robust PNS problem, which is the extension of the structural PNS problem used to model process network synthesis. This problem is NP-hard thus a heuristic algorithm can be very useful for large instances, where we do not have enough time for an exponential time algorithm, presenting a surely optimal solution, or they can be used to fasten branch and bound based algorithms. We present new heuristic algorithms for the solution of the problem which are extensions of the heuristic algorithms used to solve the classical structural PNS problem. The algorithms are analyzed empirically, where we compare the efficiency on randomly generated inputs.

AB  - A manufacturing system consists of operating units which convert their input materials into their output materials. In the problem of designing a process network, we have to find a suitable network of operating units which produces the desired products from the given raw materials. If we consider this process network design problem from a structural point of view, then minimizing the cost of the network leads to an NP-complete combinatorial optimization problem called Process Network Synthesis or PNS problem. In this paper we define an extension of the PNS problem, where probability of failure, operating time and repair time are assigned to the operating units, and some costs are assigned to the system. We provide algorithms that determine the probability of system failure, the operating units which should be used, and the scheduling of the reparation of operating units in order to obtain expected optimal operation of the system. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The P-graph (process graph) framework is applied herein for the bus maintenance planning in the public transport system. Public transportation is an essential part of the life of each major city. A number of logistic tasks have to be handled day by day in order to ensure uninterrupted operation. Malfunctions can result in additional cost, delays, discomfort, and bad reputation. Undisturbed operation requires solving both scheduling and planning optimization problems. One of these problems is the planning of the regular maintenance tasks which are mostly carried out in the night shift at our industrial partner. If maintenance is not planed properly then not enough buses are available for service. A P-graph based model has been developed for such a maintenance scheduling problem which is capable to take into account not only the night period but the whole day including the usually unused time of the buses during daytime. The appropriate scheduling of maintenance is especially important if the average age of the buses is high and thus the break downs are common. It is highly difficult to ensure the required number of serviceable buses for each morning shift without proper maintenance scheduling. Using the proposed systematic method, a better maintenance schedule can be developed where certain repair tasks can occur between the morning and afternoon rush hours. This will reduce the cost as repairs at night are more expensive. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A method and software are proposed for optimal building-evacuation-route planning in terms of identifying evacuation routes and scheduling of evacuees on each route. First, the building-evacuation routes are represented by a P-graph, which gives rise to a time-expanded process-network synthesis (PNST) problem that can be algorithmically solved by the P-graph framework. In the proposed method, each location and passage in the building is given by a set of attributes to be taken into account in the evacuation-route planning. The evacuation time is calculated as a minimum cost of the corresponding PN ST. In addition to the globally optimal solution, the P-graph framework provides the n-best sub-optimal solutions. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by two examples. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The determination of reaction pathways is one of the most important functions that should be performed in exploring the kinetics of catalyzed chemical reactions or biochemical reactions, the latter being generally catalyzed by enzymes. It is proven that the terms, "type-I extreme pathway" and "structurally minimal pathway", both introduced to characterize the kinetics of a catalyzed reaction are equivalent. These two terms are based on two distinct methodologies, one mainly rooted in convex analysis and the other in graph theory. The equivalence promises further even more effective methods for reaction-pathway identification by synergistic integration of existing ones. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A framework is presented for the automated superstructure generation and optimization of distributed energy supply systems (DESS). Based on a basic problem description (specifying load cases, available technologies, and topographic constraints), the presented framework first employs the P-graph approach for the generation of an initial superstructure containing exactly one unit of each feasible technology. DESS, however, require to account for multiple redundant conversion units, and thus a successive approach is employed to automatically expand the initial P-graph superstructure. In addition, topographic constraints are incorporated. The expanded superstructure is automatically converted into a mathematical model using a generic component-based modeling approach. Here, a robust MILP formulation is used to rigorously optimize the structure, sizing and operation of DESS. The employed MILP formulation accounts for time-varying load profiles, continuous equipment sizing, and part-load dependent operating efficiencies. In the present implementation, a GAMS model is generated that can be readily optimized. The methodology is applied to a real-world case study. It is shown that the framework conveniently and efficiently enables automated grassroots and retrofit synthesis of DESS identifying unexpected and complex designs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The current work reveals a methodology that provides an adequate basis to portray and model supply chains mathematically and formally as well as to synthesize optimal and alternative supply scenarios algorithmically while taking into account structural redundancy. The proposed methodology is based on the combinatorial foundations of algorithmic process synthesis or more specifically on the P-graph framework. A biodiesel supply network involving blending and transportation serves as an illustrative example. A novel algorithm generates the mathematical model and alternative solutions to increase reliability of supply scenarios. Major steps of the generation are the structure generation and estimation of reliability of a supply scenario. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - An effective strategy comprising two phases is proposed to determine the thermodynamically dominant pathways in a metabolic network of a given phenotype, involving several metabolic reactions. In the first phase, stoichiometrically feasible metabolic pathways are exhaustively identified through the flux balance analysis and the graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs. In the second phase, thermodynamically dominant pathways are selected from these stoichiometrically feasible metabolic pathways on the basis of the Gibbs free energy change of reaction. The proposed strategy's efficacy is demonstrated by applying it to two E. coli models: one is for maximal acetate and ethanol production, and the other is for maximalpoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) production. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The primary aim of process-network synthesis, or PNS in short, is to determine the best process network achieving a desired goal, e.g., producing a set of desired products or satisfy demands. PNS has a long history, and numerous methods for executing it are available. Its acceleratedly increasing importance can be attributed to the need to respond to the rapid emergence of new technologies and fast changes in the economic environment. It is highly desirable that any corporation be able to ascertain if a new technology is viable for its business as well as to assess if its current technology remains sustainable in the changing environment. Herein, a novel method and software for PNS are proposed for generating, optimizing, and analyzing alternative process designs at the conceptual level. The method is illustrated by synthesizing alternative process designs with different network structures for the production of butanol, ethanol, and acetone from grains. Furthermore, the sustainability of the resultant process designs is analyzed. This is executed by varying the payout period and the production rate, i.e., load. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present work proposes a computer-aided methodology for designing sustainable supply chains in terms of sustainability metrics by utilizing the P-graph framework. The methodology is an outcome of the collaboration between the Office of Research and Development (ORD) of the U.S. EPA and the research group led by the creators of the P-graph framework at the University of Pannonia. The integration of supply chain design and sustainability is the main focus of this collaboration. The P-graph framework provides a mathematically rigorous procedure for synthesizing optimal and alternative suboptimal networks subject to multiple objectives and constraints, which include profitability and sustainability in the proposed methodology. Specifically, to evaluate the sustainability of a given process under construction including its supply chain, sustainability metrics are incorporated into the design procedure. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with the optimal design of a supply chain for providing heat and electric power to an agricultural region with relatively limited land area where agricultural wastes can potentially be recovered as renewable resources. The objective functions for optimization comprise the profit and the ecological footprint. The results of the study indicate that, compared to using electricity from the grid and/or natural gas, using renewable energy resources can yield substantial cost reductions of up to 5%, as well as significant ecological footprint reductions of up to 77%. It may, therefore, be possible to design more sustainable supply chains that are both cost-effective and less environmentally damaging. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sustainability is about adaptively managing the environment on an on-going basis so as to insure that the Earth can continue to support human existence for the indefinite future. Supply chain design methodologies, e.g. p-graph framework, along with integrated sustai nability metrics (emergy and ecological footprint) along with cost can provide insight into supply chain performance. Carefully designed supply chains can be made cheaper and more environmentally friendly than current practice while meeting societal needs. Delicate trade-off appear on scale-up of supply chain.

TI  - Extended P-graph applications in supply chain and Process Network Synthesis
AU  - Lam, H.L.
T2  - Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering
AB  - The fast development of new products, process technologies and production methods has made the decision making in process design and synthesis a complicated task. Combination of all feasible process pathways and solutions creates a huge super structure. Thus, to determine the optimum solution and flexible alternative solution is a big challenge for Process Network Synthesis (PNS). Process graph (P-graph) approach has been extended gradually to provide a friendly and fast optimum result for PNS problem. This paper overviews the application of P-graph in new PNS areas in the aspect of synthesis, optimisation, planning and management. The paper demonstrates the extension of P-graph via several case studies such as effective supply chain systems, carbon emission reduction systems and cleaner production process synthesis. The paper also highlights the advantages of P-graph in process network synthesis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we define and investigate a new direction of the P-graph-based Business Process Modeling which we call the robust PNS problem. We consider the model where for each operating unit two costs are given, it has a nominal cost and an extended cost, and we know that at most b operating units have the extended cost, the others will have the nominal cost. We present a branch and bound based exact solution algorithm for the general problem, and a faster, polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm for the case of the hierarchycal problems.

AB  - Hitherto, no attempt has been made to identify exhaustively feasible pathways for any mechanism of a given reaction catalyzed by a catalyst with multiactive sites. Two stoichiometically exact and definitely feasible mechanisms have been proposed to date for the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane on biactive-site or triactive-site platinum catalysts. One comprises seven elementary reactions, and the other comprises eight elementary reactions; nevertheless, both mechanisms involve competitive as well as noncompetitive adsorption. Any of these mechanisms gives rise to a multitude of feasible catalytic pathways. The present work exhaustively identifies such feasible pathways by resorting to the inordinately efficient graph-theoretic algorithm based on P-graphs (process graphs). The efficacy of this algorithm has been amply demonstrated by successfully deploying it for several catalysts with single-active sites, but has never been deployed for catalysts with multiactive sites as in the current work. The availability of exhaustively identified feasible pathways for both mechanisms renders it possible to stipulate that the hydrogenation of chemisorbed chemisorbed C 2H 5 is the rate-controlling step: This step is contained in either mechanism. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A novel framework is proposed for the automated generation and optimization of models representing superstructures of distributed energy supply systems (DESS). Based on a basic problem description specifying load cases, available technologies, and topographical constraints, the presented framework employs the P-graph approach as an initialization step. Since DESS require accounting for time-varying load profiles and part-load dependent operating efficiencies, the P-graph superstructure is automatically extended, as necessary, to include multiple redundant energy conversion units. The proposed framework employs a robust MILP formulation to automatically derive the optimization model representing the generated superstructure. In the present implementation, a GAMS model is generated that can be readily optimized. In a case study, the synthesis optimization of an industrial site is analyzed. It is shown that the framework conveniently and efficiently enables the automated grassroots and retrofit synthesis of DESS identifying unexpected and complex designs with multiple redundant units and trigeneration systems.

AB  - The P-graph framework is proven to be highly effective in solving Process Network Synthesis. In the present work, the P-graph framework has been adopted for solving the routing and scheduling of evacuees, facing a life-threatening situation. First the building evacuation problem is represented by means of a P-graph model, which is then transformed into a time-expanded process network synthesis (PNST) problem that can be algorithmically handled by the P-graph framework. In the proposed method, each location in the building and their passages are given by a set of attributes to be taken in the evacuation route planning. In addition to the globally optimal solution of the building evacuation problem, the P-graph framework provides the n-best suboptimal solutions, when computational possible. The viability of the proposed model is illustrated by an example. Copyright © 2012, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The cost effective and error free management solution of the complex business processes as well as the solution's efficiency rate are corner points in the life of profit and non-profit oriented organizations and institutions, since the optimal efficiency of the complicated office-automation processes is of primary economic interest. Workflow is the most widespread modeling technique application in the field of office information systems. This paper introduces a new extension of the P-graph-based workflow modeling. The new model, apart from the management of the process-structure, enables the management of the input, temporary, and output documents, is capable of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the necessary and available resources, as well as the management of the resource- and other type of constraints and other bottlenecks. © 2011 IEEE.

T. Fan, Department of Chemical Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS The present work proposes a computer-aided methodology for designing sustainable supply chains in terms of sustainability metrics by resorting to the P-graph framework. The methodology is an outcome of the collaboration between the Office of Research and Development (ORD) of the U.S. EPA and the research group led by the founders of the P-graph framework. U.S. EPA/ORD has substantial creditable experience with the development of indicators and metrics for sustainability, while the P-graph framework is deemed to be highly effective for algorithmic design of process networks including supply chains. The integration of supply chain design and sustainability is the main focus of the collaboration.</p>

AB  - A method and software are proposed for optimal assignment of vehicles to transportation tasks in terms of total cost and emission. The assignment problem is transformed into a process-network synthesis problem that can be algorithmically handled by the P-graph framework. In the proposed method, each task is given by a set of attributes to be taken account in the assignment; this is also the case for each vehicle. The overall mileage is calculated as the sum of the lengths of all the routes to be travelled during, before, after, and between the tasks (Desaulniers et al. 1998; Baita et al. 2000). Cost and emission are assigned to the mileages of each vehicle type. In addition to the globally optimal solution of the assignment problem, the P-graph framework provides the n-best suboptimal solutions that can be ranked according to multiple criteria. The viability of the proposed method is illustrated by an example. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - Integrated and combined cycles traditionally involve gas and steam turbines only. The paper analyses the integration of high-temperature fuel cells (FC) into Fuel Cell Combined Cycles (FCCC) and their use for the synthesis of complete CHP (Combined Heat and Power) networks. A synthesis procedure is presented utilising biomass and fossil fuels. This involves significant combinatorial complexity efficiently handled by the P-graph framework and its associated algorithms. This contribution provides a tool based on a procedure for efficient evaluation of early-stage energy technologies, specifying a set of market conditions and then testing the resilience of the design against variations of key parameters. The results show that such systems employing renewable fuels can be economically viable for a wide range of economic conditions, mainly due to the high energy efficiency of the FC-based systems. Further research and development with industrial relevance are outlined focusing on CO2 emissions reduction.

AB  - The utilization of renewable resources poses new challenges to process design. Consumption of renewable raw materials, or feedstock, often encounter limitations and uncertainties that are foreign to the design of processes based on fossil fuels whose availability is presumably uninterruptible. The algorithms and software of the graphtheoretic method based on process graphs (P-graphs) are elaborated for generating optimal and near-optimal supply networks for manufacturing a set of products at certain production levels with given reliabilities. Apparently, the sole currently available approach capable of rigorously and efficiently executing optimal process-network synthesis is that based on the P-graph framework. The approach leads to an algorithmically and mathematically proven solution for all steps involved. Such steps comprise superstructure generation, construction of the mathematical model, optimization, and the solution interpretation. The proposed method is illustrated with an example involving the utilization of renewable feedstock, namely agricultural products, whose uninterrupted availability tends to be uncertain.

AB  - A novel programming framework has been developed for the P-graph-based methodology to provide a standardized software environment for different classes of process-network synthesis (PNS) problems. The P-graph framework has been proven highly successful; its applicability encompasses wide-ranging areas such as reaction-pathway identification, vehicle-routing problems and business-process modeling. A uniform programming paradigm has been proposed here to integrate various available solution engines and interfaces of different types of PNS problems into a single system. A client server architecture with a standardized communication protocol has also been developed, which renders it to be deployable by various client programs with different features, possibly implementable in different programming languages, or adoptable by varied solvers customized for specific problems. Numerous P-graph-based algorithms have been implemented to demonstrate the efficacy of the P-graph framework. Copyright © 2010 AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

T2  - 8th World Congress of Chemical Engineering: Incorporating the 59th Canadian Chemical Engineering Conference and the 24th Interamerican Congress of Chemical Engineering
AB  - A method for regional energy targeting and supply chain synthesis is presented. A demand-driven approach is applied to assess the feasible ways for transferring energy from renewable sources to customers in a given region. The studied region is partitioned into a number of clusters using the Regional Energy Clustering (REC) algorithm. The REC targets aim at minimizing the system carbon footprint. Energy supply chain synthesis is performed within each cluster using the P-graph framework. The synthesis algorithm generated a maximal structure containing all feasible options, from which solution structures were obtained. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 8th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (Montreal, Quebec, Canada 8/23-27/2009).

AB  - Workflow is the most widespread modeling technique application in the field of business and office information systems. In the previous paper introduced P-graph-based workflow modeling extended by the introduction of resource management is a systematic, fast method of optimal workflow model generation based on network synthesis with correct mathematical background. In this paper a further extension, a fuzzy extension of this P-graph-based workflow model is introduced. The goal of the new extension is to achieve a better modeling of real processes, and a better management of real life, ambiguous, non-exactly definable situations. ©2009IEEE.

AB  - The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) for the production of widely distributed hydrocarbons through the catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) has been intensively and extensively explored. This is attributable to its immense theoretical as well as practical importance. Naturally, such exploration would be greatly facilitated if the feasible or dominant catalytic pathways (mechanisms) of FTS can be determined. The stoichiometrically feasible and independent catalytic pathways (IPi's) of FTS have been exhaustively identified via the rigorous graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs (process graphs). The most extensive set of elementary reactions available, which numbers 26, has yielded 24 IPi's in less than 1 s on a PC. The plausibly dominant pathways have been selected from the stoichiometrically feasible pathways through the analysis of their activation energies. Naturally, the dominant pathway or pathways need ultimately be discriminated among these plausibly dominant pathways via various means, e.g., in situ spectroscopic measurements of intermediates. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The optimal and near-optimal enterprise-wide networks are designed, that is synthesized, for supplying feedstocks and distributing multiple products manufactured from these feedstocks in the process industry by resorting to the graph-theoretic method based on process graphs (P-graphs). Such feedstocks and products, conveyed through supply networks, are invariably materials for which the law of mass conservation is universally valid. Moreover, any of the actions applied to or exerted on a given feedstock or product, transiting through the supply networks, will induce a change in at least one of its attributes, thereby transforming the feedstock or product. Examples of the actions are loading, blending, pumping, tracking, unloading, subdividing, and/or wrapping; and those of the attributes are chemical composition, physical state, flow characteristics, external appearance, and/or location. Thus, in the broadest sense, any supply network can be regarded as a process network. The feedstocks and the products manufactured from them serve as the raw materials for and the products from the supply network at its entrance and exit, respectively. An operating, that is functional, unit can be unequivocally identified where any action is exerted on these raw materials or products. Naturally, the networks can be represented graph-theoretically as P-graphs. The proposed method is illustrated with an example involving three process plants, three markets, and three products under the three scenarios of coordination, cooperation, and competition. It has given rise simultaneously to the optimal as well as near-optimal supply networks in the ranked order. The example, formulated as the mixed integer linear programming problem, yields the same optimal solutions only, but not the near-optimal solutions in the ranked order. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work deals with multiperiod-operation HEN synthesis and explores the use of the Process Graph (P-graph) with its associated algorithms for the problem. Heat exchanger networks (HEN) synthesis has been evolving from a steady state towards design flexibility and resilience. It designs a network for a set of steady states, assigned to operation periods - multiperiod operation. The P-graph enables the systematic automated generation of rigorous superstructures and the derivation of the optimal solution HENs via the combinatorially Accelerated Branch and Bound optimisation algorithm (ABB).

TI  - P-Graph-based workflow modelling
AU  - Tick, J.
T2  - Acta Polytechnica Hungarica
AB  - Workflow modelling has been successfully introduced and implemented in several application fields. Therefore, its significance has increased dramatically. Several work flow modelling techniques have been published so far, out of which quite a number are widespread applications. For instance the Petri-Net-based modelling has become popular partly due to its graphical design and partly due to its correct mathematical background. The workflow modelling based on Unified Modelling Language is important because of its practical usage. This paper introduces and examines the workflow modelling technique based on the Process-graph as a possible new solution next to the already existing modelling techniques.

AB  - A hierarchical approach is presented to estimate the sustainability- potential of the alternative synthetic routes for a chemical to be manufactured. The notion of sustainability-potential is a generalization of the notion of profit-potential,1 the estimation of which renders it possible to screen out economically non-viable processes derived from the alternative synthetic routes at the earliest stage.

AB  - Novel processing equipment, i.e., operating units, such as reactors and separators, which are deemed to be technically feasible, are continually under development for commercialization. It is, however, not always easy to establish the target or benchmark in terms of price to gauge if the operating unit under development has become economically viable or cost-effective: The economic viability or cost-effectiveness is invariably application-specific. For instance, pervaporation is technically one of the most promising separation methods developed in recent years for removing volatile organics from their dilute mixtures and solutions.1-5 Nevertheless, it might be cost-effective only for manufacturing pharmaceuticals having exorbitant prices but not for the large-tonnage production of an organic chemical or solvent of relatively low price at the current stage of its development.

AB  - Most frequently, process synthesis is executed by resorting to mathematical programming. Nevertheless, its most crucial step, i.e., the generation of the mathematical model, has been largely ignored. The present contribution demonstrates that the mathematical model generated in algorithmic process synthesis based on mathematical programming affects profoundly the quality of the solution and the necessary computational time. It has been illustrated that the P-graph framework gives rise to a consistent methodology for generating the mathematical model and its solution.

TI  - Systematic waste minimization in chemical processes. 3. Batch operations
AU  - Halim, I.

T2  - Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research
AB  - The current drive toward ecosustainability has provided a strong impetus to implement waste minimization within the chemical industries. However, conducting a waste minimization analysis is expensive, time-consuming, laborious, and knowledge-intensive. In part 1 of this series [Halim, I.; Srinivasan, R. Systematic Waste Minimization in Chemical Processes: Part I. Methodology. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2002, 41 (2), 196], we described a systematic methodology based on the Environmental Optimization (ENVOP) technique for waste minimization analysis of chemical plants. In part 2 [Halim, I.; Srinivasan, R. Systematic Waste Minimization in Chemical Processes: Part II. Intelligent Decision Support System. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2002, 41 (2), 208], we reported on ENVOPExpert, an expert system that implements the methodology. While the focus in parts 1 and 2 were on continuous processes, in part 3 we extend the waste minimization methodology to batch process plants and describe its implementation as an expert system called BATCH-ENVOPExpert (BEE). In contrast to continuous processes, during batch processing different wastes may be generated at different times even from the same process unit. The process flow diagram that serves as the backbone for ENVOP analysis therefore does not completely represent the waste generation mechanisms, and the process recipe has to be analyzed to both diagnose the source of waste generation and identify process modifications that will eliminate it. In this paper, we extend the process graph based waste diagnosis approach described in parts 1 and 2 for continuous processes to batch processes by incorporating knowledge and operating procedures of the process recipe, which can be modeled using Grafcets. A process graph (P-graph) model of the operation can then be generated by considering the flow diagram and the Grafcet of the process. This P-graph can be analyzed to diagnose the waste sources and heuristic-based waste minimization solutions can be derived at a high level. Specific variable-level solutions can also be implied by combining cause-andeffect knowledge and functional models of the process. We illustrate the approach by performing waste minimization analysis on an industrial herbicide manufacturing case study and compare our results with the available experts' solutions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Supply network modeling normally involves large scale and is often highly complex to be defined. Existing methods such as mixed integer linear programming solve the problems of simple decision or of moderate scale, but cannot manage the large scale realistic problems. In addition, they cannot provide alternative solution in case that the optimum solution cannot be applied in real business for various reasons. In this study, graphical representation of supply networks is studied for process graph modeling of a hypothetical example. The proposed graphical approach is expected to overcome these weaknesses of mixed integer programming. It endows visibility to the networks and a set of feasible solutions in the changing business environment. © 2006 ICASE.

AB  - Cell robustness and complexity have been recognized as unique features of biological systems. Such robustness and complexity of metabolic-reaction systems can be explored by discovering, or identifying, the multiple flux distributions (MFD) and redundant pathways that lead to a given external state; however, this is exceedingly cumbersome to accomplish. It is, therefore, highly desirable to establish an effective computational method for their identification, which, in turn, gives rise to a novel insight into the cellular function. An effective approach is proposed for complementarily identifying MFD in metabolic flux analysis and multiple metabolic pathways (MMP) in structural pathway analysis. This approach judiciously integrates flux balance analysis (FBA) based on linear programming and the graph-theoretic method for determining reaction pathways. A single metabolic pathway, with the concomitant flux distribution and the overall reaction manifesting itself as the desired phenotype under some environmental conditions, is determined by FBA from the initial candidate sequence of metabolic reactions. Subsequently, the graph-theoretic method recovers all feasible MMP and the corresponding MFD. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated by applying it to the in silico Escherichia coli model under various culture conditions. The resultant MMP and MFD attaining a unique external state reveal the surprising adaptability and robustness of the intricate cellular network as a key to cell survival against environmental or genetic changes. These results indicate that the proposed approach would be useful in facilitating drug discovery. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - Scalable Computing
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach that formulates different types of diagnostic problems similarly. The main idea is the reformulation of the diagnostic procedures as P-graph models. In this way the same paradigm can be applied to model different aspects of a complex problem. The idea is illustrated by solving the probabilistic diagnosis problem in multiprocessor systems and by extending it with some additional properties. Thus, potential link errors and intermittent faults are taken into consideration and the comparator based diagnostics is formulated including potential comparator errors. © 2005 SWPS.

AB  - Renewable resources pose special challenges to process synthesis. Due to decentral raw material generation, usually low transport densities and the perishable character of most renewable raw materials in combination with their time dependent availability, logistical questions as well as adaptation to regional agricultural structures are necessary. This calls for synthesis of structures not only of single processes but of the whole value chain attached to the utilisation of a certain resource. As most of the innovative technologies proposed to build on a renewable raw material base face stiff economic competition from fossil based processes, economic optimality of the value chain is crucial to their implementation. On top of this widening of the process definition for synthesis, many processes on the base of renewable resources apply technologies (like membrane separations, chromatographic purification steps, etc.) for which the heuristic knowledge is still slim. This reduces the choice of methods for process synthesis, mainly to methods based on combinatorial principles. The paper investigates applicability as well as impact on technology development of process synthesis for renewable raw material utilisation. It takes logistic considerations into account and applies process synthesis to the case study of the green biorefinery concept. The results show the great potential of process synthesis for technology development of renewable resource utilisation. Applied early in the development phase, it can point towards the most promising utilisation pathways, thus guiding the engineering work. On top of that, and even more important, it can help avoid costly development flops as it also clearly indicates "blind alleys" that have to be avoided. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A graph-theoretic method to identify candidate mechanisms for deriving the rate law of a catalytic reaction

T2  - Computers and Chemistry
AB  - Stoichiometrically, exact candidate pathways or mechanisms for deriving the rate law of a catalytic or complex reaction can be determined through the synthesis of networks of plausible elementary reactions constituting such pathways. A rigorous algorithmic method is proposed for executing this synthesis, which is exceedingly convoluted due to its combinatorial complexity. Such a method for synthesizing networks of reaction pathways follows the general framework of a highly exacting combinatorial method established by us for process-network synthesis. It is based on the unique graph-representation in terms of P-graphs, a set of axioms, and a group of combinatorial algorithms. In the method, the inclusion or exclusion of a step of each elementary reaction in the mechanism of concern hinges on the general combinatorial properties of feasible reaction networks. The decisions are facilitated by solving linear programming problems comprising a set of mass-balance constraints to determine the existence or absence of any feasible solution. The search is accelerated further by exploiting the inferences of preceding decisions, thereby eliminating redundancy. As a result, all feasible independent reaction networks, i.e. pathways, are generated only once; the pathways violating any first principle of either stoichiometry or thermodynamics are eliminated. The method is also capable of generating those combinations of independent pathways directly, which are not microscopically reversible. The efficiency and efficacy of the method are demonstrated with the identification of the feasible mechanisms of ammonia synthesis involving as many as 14 known elementary reactions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Stoichiometrically exact, candidate pathways, i.e., mechanisms, for deriving the rate law of the catalytic synthesis of ammonia have been determined through the synthesis of networks of known elementary reactions constituting such pathways. This has been undertaken to reassess the validity of available mechanisms and to explore the possible existence of additional ones for the catalytic synthesis of ammonia. Synthesizing the networks of elementary reactions is exceedingly convoluted due to the combinatorial complexity arising from the fact the number of elementary reactions involved usually far exceeds that of available elementary balances, which is only 2 for the ammonia synthesis. Such a complexity can be circumvented by the rigorous and highly efficient, graph-theoretic method adopted in the present contribution. This method follows the general framework of a mathematically exact, combinatorial method established for process-network synthesis. It is based on a unique graph-representation in terms of process graphs (P-graphs), a set of axioms, and a group of combinatorial algorithms. The method renders it possible to generate with dispatch all feasible independent reaction networks, i.e., pathways, only once. The pathways violating any first principle of either stoichiometry or thermodynamics are eliminated. Moreover, the method is capable of directly generating rapidly the acyclic combinations of independent pathways.

AB  - A rigorous method for identifying biochemical reaction or metabolic pathways through its systematic synthesis has been established. The current method for synthesizing networks of metabolic pathways follows the general framework of a highly exacting combinatorial method. The method is capable of generating not only all combinatorially independent, feasible reaction networks only once, but also those combinations of independent pathways. A case study involving the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with 14 elementary reactions illustrates the efficiency and efficacy of the method. All the results have been obtained with a PC (Pentium-III 550 MHz, 256 MB RAM) within 1 S.

TI  - Synthesizing alternative sequences via a P-graph-based approach in azeotropic distillation systems

T2  - 2nd Conference on Process Integration Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction (PRES'99)
AB  - The present work proposes a P-graph based approach capable of systematically generating all combinatorially feasible alternative sequences for both continuous and batch azeotropic distillation systems when the feeds, products, and operating units and their concomitant intermediate materials are known. To facilitate synthesis, a highly effective method has been established to identify processing or operating units necessary for constructing azeotropic-distillation systems by means of first principles and logical sequencing of such units. The materials represented in the space of the residue curve map are partitioned into lumped materials bounded by thermodynamic boundaries and pinches, e.g. distillation boundaries and liquid-liquid phase equilibrium envelope.

The present work proposes a P-graph based approach capable of systematically generating all combinatorially feasible alternative sequences for both continuous and batch azeotropic distillation systems when the feeds, products, and operating units and their concomitant intermediate materials are known. To facilitate synthesis, a highly effective method has been established to identify processing or operating units necessary for constructing azeotropic-distillation systems by means of first principles and logical sequencing of such units. The materials represented in the space of the residue curve map are partitioned into lumped materials bounded by thermodynamic boundaries and pinches, e.g. distillation boundaries and liquid-liquid phase equilibrium envelope. Subsequently, the operating units are identified on the basis of these lumped materials. The proposed approach automatically discards the operating units and intermediates whose inclusion will lead to infeasible sequences. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated with a realistic example.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose a method for synthesizing the optimal mass exchange network (MEN). In order to synthesize optimal MEN, it is necessary to determine the network structure and its operating conditions. The material and operating unit nodes that are essential to use the Process graph theory (Friedler et al., 1992) are denned. The maximal structure of MEN synthesis problem can be easily obtained using the P-graph theory. Furthermore, only feasible structures can be extracted from the maximal structure, the size of the search space is extremely reduced. The feasible structures are formulated as nonlinear programming problems (NLP) and their operating conditions are determined by optimization of NLP.

AB  - Process system engineering approaches have a considerably broader reach, which is one of the benefits for decision-makers. Making a decision, however, has many drawbacks. It includes biased decisions, timeconsuming analyses, and an unpredictable future. A decision-making integration framework based on hybrid process network synthesis and machine learning was presented in this study. The municipal solid waste management case study uses to demonstrate the applicability decision-making framework. The focus of this paper is to facilitate equipment selection for municipal solid waste management. P-graph was used to generate the 160 possible structures. Then, using the WEKA software, the data from the feasible structure would be processed and evaluated using the chosen algorithm. The J48 is the best model for equipment selection using an 80:20 ratio train and test learning technique in WEKA. The kappa statistics J48 algorithm function for the training and testing dataset is 0.9722 and 1. The mean absolute error and root mean square error are 0.0042 and 0.0354. The decision-making integration framework represents by a graphical user interface in MATLAB. The focus of user interface for selection of waste conversion technologies. As a result, the model can be used to determine the best municipal solid waste conversion technology.

AB  - The current paper is about a process network synthesis solution for a bus transport problem, where arbitrary launching data are given in an available timetable. Here, the bus transport problem is presented as an application of the p-graph methodology and is investigated from structural point of view. Focusing on the synthesis step, the bus transport process network is generated and detailed. Based on the maximal structure of the problem a mathematical programming model is generated which has the advantage of a smaller number of variables and constraints than the conventional mathematical models for similar problems. The solution of the mathematical programming model, results in the optimal solution of the bus transport problem. From the traffic point of view, an example of medium difficulty is solved, by a publicly available solver.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a novel framework for the optimisation of downstream oil supply chains with emission-cost nexus and performance analysis. A P-graph based model has been developed to support the decisions of the distribution plan in the supply chain. This created the possibility to consider constraints, including the material balance, the sending capacity of refineries and storage depots, and the transport capacity of railways, barges and pipelines. Three scenarios, covering standard conditions, pipeline disruption, and demand increase, are analysed. The proposed novel method supports the decision-making of downstream oil supply chains and provides insight into the reduction of environmental influences. The results reveal that priority should be given to measures for reducing NOx emission (both Greenhouse and dangerous pollution gas) and the emission factors of barge transport, as this can bring great environmental benefit. When NOx emission for railways and barges is reduced by 5%, 1,435 kCNY/month could be saved. If the emission of the barges is reduced by 5%, this can save 1,289 kCNY/month of environmental cost. The proposed method is handy for analysis under non-standard conditions, such as transport facility disruption and demand increase. It would help in the design a distribution plan from a more comprehensive view, and to provide further direction for reducing the environmental footprint.

AB  - The rise in world population and industrialization in developing nations has tremendously increased the demand for water and has resulted in wastewater contaminated with several pollutants. Thus, wastewater treatment (WWT), reuse, and safe disposal have become crucial for sustainable existence. We believe that generation of a maximal structure (superstructure) comprising of all possible treatment methods and flow patterns using a systems approach, followed by optimization to decide the best treatment pathway, will enable efficient designing of WWT networks. In this work, the technologies/methods involved in WWT such as sedimentation, filtration, membranes, adsorption, activated sludge, etc. are modelled using material and energy balances, equipment design, costing and environmental impact. Utilizing systematic methods (e.g. mixed-integer non-linear programming, MINLP), we frame the WWT network selection as an optimization problem for cost and energy minimization along with sustainable goals. In our analysis, we demonstrate a case study of Municipal WWT and determine the best strategy in compliance with the 1972 US EPA's Clean Water Act to reuse the treated water for cropland irrigation. In the next step, we use the P-graph approach for solving the same problem and this tool provides a ranked list of candidate solutions.

AB  - The question on the optimal development of the heat sources in the developing heat-supply systems (HSSs) is considered. The current state of research in the field in question is analyzed. It is noted that this issue has aroused increased interest in recent years. The description and mathematical formulation of the problem of optimizing the structure of the heat sources in the developing HSSs are provided. The best distribution of the load between the former is determined and the choice of the optimal parameters of the heat-supply networks under permissible technical, economic, and ecological restrictions is made. For the first time, the problem has been formulated and implemented using the method of directed search for possible variants of the heat source's power and equipment content in a preplanned redundant heat-source configuration that was previously used to search for the best configuration of the heat-supply network. To devise redundant configurations and subsequently calculate them, methodological approaches oriented towards the construction of P-graphs and energy hubs that have been developed in recent years can be successfully applied. Every heat-source structure variant outlined within the framework of the redundant configuration competes with other variants not only in terms of the minimum costs but also in terms of the minimum impact on the environment. The proposed methodology was implemented in the form of a software package that enables the user to interactively communicate with the digital model of the system to obtain a solution for the development and reconstruction of the HSS under investigation. The practical application of the methodological and computational tools to solve the problem of the development of heat-supply systems is exemplified by the configuration of the heat-supply system of the settlement of Magistralnyi, Irkutsk region.

AU  - Varbanov, P

T2  - APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Fuel cells are under extensive investigation for building combined energy cycles due to the higher efficiency potential they offer. Two kinds of high-temperature fuel cells (HTFC) have been identified as best candidates for fuel cell combined cycles (FCCC) - molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). The paper presents a procedure for the evaluation of energy conversion systems involving FCCC subsystems, utilising biomass and/or fossil fuels, providing a tool for evaluation of the trends in CO, emission levels and economics of such systems. This involves significant combinatorial complexity, efficiently handled by the P-graph algorithms. Promising system components are evaluated using the P-graph framework and a methodology for the synthesis of cost-optimal FCCC configurations is developed, accounting for the carbon footprint of the various technology and fuel options. The results show that such systems employing renewable fuels can be economically viable for a wide range of economic conditions, mainly due to the high energy efficiency of the FC-based systems.

AB  - Rational allocation of scarce resources in a crisis is an integral part of risk management. In the case of energy systems, for example, the onset of climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events which will further affect not only the reliability of electricity transmission and fuel resource delivery but also test the integrity of energy infrastructure systems. Electricity supply is essential to all economic sectors and the onset of an energy crisis resulting from a calamity, an accident, an infrastructure failure or a political dispute will affect the productivity of the entire economy. Furthermore, the interdependencies between sectors can cause “ripple effects” to occur. Input-output models are an established methodology for quantifying such linkages in an economic system. During a power crisis, it is essential to provide a rational basis for allocation of limited energy supply in order to minimize its economic ripple effects. The best allocation for damage control can be determined by representing an input-output system as a P-graph model. The latter is a graph-theoretic approach originally developed for chemical process design applications, and the analogous problem structures allow it to be used for the optimal allocation of electricity to various economic sectors in the event of a power crisis. We demonstrate the methodology using a case study based on Philippine input-output data.

Results of simulations on a hybrid rice and crayfish production system indicate that comparable levels of productivity can be achieved with different ecological network structures.

AB  - In this study, an optimal scheme is proposed by utilizing waste streams at a plant-wide scale along with pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) membrane allocation in complex industrial networks for energy recovery. Chemical exergy pinch analysis (ChExPA) and process graph (P-graph) are used to address the problem. The ultimate goals of utilizing the tools are (1) determine the optimal external load consumption, (2) minimizing the waste discharge, and (3) sustainable energy production while utilizing high chemical exergy potential waste discharges. A reliability assessment assisted with Monte-Carlo simulation is further performed to evaluate the proposed solutions from P-graph considering uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is explained using three industrial case studies which covered both intra-plant and inter-plant networks. The results indicated that ChExPA and P-graph can effectively identify the optimal location of the PRO membrane in industrial networks. Upon analyzing the complex inter-plant industrial networks 7.795 MW net power output was harnessed, and significantly higher waste of 384.92 kg/s was recovered with a levelized cost of energy of 0.073 $/kWh. The inter-plant network shows the greatest net profit which accounted for approximately $1,191,000 (i.e., 5.84 times higher than stand-alone plants) with a reasonable payback-period of 4.5 years.

AB  - The resilience of a system is defined as the system's capability of recovering from failures. Traditionally, only predictable aspects are considered when designing processing systems. Evaluation of these aspects is performed via assessment of exact indicators and enumeration of all cause-effect options. However, such evaluation is not appropriate for determining the resilience of processing systems, since resilience is based on unexpected events in addition to the expected ones. Consequently, the cause part of the cause-effect relation is not known or not effective. In the current work, the general formula for determining resilience of a system is embedded into a P-graph based process synthesis algorithm. Thus, the resilience can be considered when selecting the most preferred process during its synthesis. The result is illustrated by synthesizing a process of adipic acid production by nitric acid oxidation of KA oil.

AB  - We propose a process graph (P-graph) approach to develop ecosystem networks from knowledge of the properties of the component species. Originally developed as a process engineering tool for designing industrial plants, the P-graph framework has key advantages over conventional ecological network analysis techniques based on input-output models. A P-graph is a bipartite graph consisting of two types of nodes, which we propose to represent components of an ecosystem. Compartments within ecosystems (e.g., organism species) are represented by one class of nodes, while the roles or functions that they play relative to other compartments are represented by a second class of nodes. This bipartite graph representation enables a powerful, unambiguous representation of relationships among ecosystem compartments, which can come in tangible (e.g., mass flow in predation) or intangible form (e.g., symbiosis). For example, within a P-graph, the distinct roles of bees as pollinators for some plants and as prey for some animals can be explicitly represented, which would not otherwise be possible using conventional ecological network analysis. After a discussion of the mapping of ecosystems into P-graph, we also discuss how this framework can be used to guide understanding of complex networks that exist in nature. Two component algorithms of P-graph, namely maximal structure generation (MSG) and solution structure generation (SSG), are shown to be particularly useful for ecological network analysis. These algorithms enable candidate ecosystem networks to be deduced based on current scientific knowledge on the individual ecosystem components. This method can be used to determine the (a) effects of loss of specific ecosystem compartments due to extinction, (b) potential efficacy of ecosystem reconstruction efforts, and (c) maximum sustainable exploitation of human ecosystem services by humans. We illustrate the use of P-graph for the analysis of ecosystem compartment loss using a small-scale stylized case study, and further propose a new criticality index that can be easily derived from SSG results. © 2020 Lao et al.

AB  - Resilience is one of the key indicators of processing systems, it expresses the behaviour of the system as a result of expected or unexpected failures. This indicator can be essential during systems design and operation, especially, when the system is part of or related to a critical infrastructure. The numerous contributions on systems resilience are related to a wide range of applications, however, there is no general uniform framework for resilience evaluation. For instance, most studies examine resilience as a function of the continuous parameters of the system, usually avoiding the influence of its structure. In the current work, a general framework for determining the structural resilience of processing systems is presented. This framework derives on formulas that satisfy the requirements of the original definition of resilience. The formerly developed P-graph framework is the mathematical basis of the procedure for determining the indicator. The resilience of the system is calculated as a function of the operative subprocesses for all possible failures and is a normalized indicator on [0, 1]. The examination of two industrial case studies shows that the proposed resilience can be an appropriate indicator to be considered in process design.

AB  - A new methodology for improving the operational efficiency of ethylene cracking integrated with refining is proposed. In this work, ethylene feedstock optimization was achieved by screening the low-value materials and naphtha in the refinery through the molecular management approach. The process synthesis-intensification model for ethylene production was developed to identify the opportunities for improving operational efficiency. The P-graph method was applied to accelerate problem solving and generate process routes with the objective function of economic gross potential. To determine the optimal process route, the comprehensive operational efficiency index and light hydrocarbon feedstock ratio were further constructed for process route evaluation. A case study of a real ethylene-refining integrated complex indicates that the proposed method could effectively optimize the operational efficiency of ethylene production and that the economic and inherent safety performances could be notably increased by 22.34% and 67.81%, respectively.

AB  - Computer networks are supposed to meet predefined security levels. Both the definition and the measurement of such security levels are usually based on subjective methods. Currently, there are no such methods based on objective parameters, which can be used to algorithmically calculate the reliability of computer networks. Reliability is often determined by the experience of IT engineers. In this paper we propose a new method that is independent of subjective criteria. Administrators and architects can measure or improve the security level of their computer networks based on objective parameters. A decision support system has been developed by us to design computer networks to maximize reliability and robustness based on the current architecture. This method is based on the theory of P-graphs. The topology given by the operator or architect can be modelled by P-graphs, and by performing optimization on this P-graph robustness can be measured. The result will be reflected back to the original topology, therefore we can make recommendations on the enhancement of the network's robustness. The algorithm in this paper is compared to an already published case study. © 2019 IEEE.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - Lignocellulosic waste (LW) is abundant in availability and is one of the suitable substrates for anaerobic digestion (AD). However, it is a complex solid substrate matrix that hinders the hydrolysis stage of anaerobic digestion. This study assessed various pre-treatment and post-treatments of lignocellulosic waste for anaerobic digestion benefiting from advanced P-graph and GaBi software (Thinkstep, Germany) from the perspective of cost and environmental performances (global warming potential, human toxicity, ozone depletion potential, particulate matter, photochemical oxidant creation, acidification and eutrophication potential). CaO pre-treatment (P4), H2S removal with membrane separation post-treatment (HSR MS) and without the composting of digestate is identified as the cost-optimal pathway. The biological (P7- Enzyme, P8- Microbial Consortium) and physical (P1- Grinding, P2- Steam Explosion, P3- Water Vapour) pre-treatments alternatives have lower environmental impacts than chemical pre-treatments (P4- CaO, P5- NaOH, P6- H2SO4) however they are not part of the near cost optimal solutions. For post-treatment, the near cost optimal alternatives are H2S removal with organic physical scrubbing (HSR OPS) and H2S removal with amine scrubbing (HSR AS). HSR AS has a better performance in the overall environmental impacts followed by HSR MS and HSR OPS. In general, the suggested cost-optimal solution is still having relatively lower environmental impacts and feasible for implementation (cost effective). There is very complicated to find a universal AD solution. Different scenarios (the type of substrate, the scale, product demand, policies) have different constraints and consequently solutions. The trade-offs between cost and environment performances should be a future extension of this work.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - The key function of an electricity transmission network is to transfer electrical energy from generators and imports to all customers reliably, at low cost, and sustainably as far as possible. The regional or country-level networks are usually highly interconnected with a large number of nodes and redundant subnetworks. Various types of power plants provide energy for the network. They are mainly nuclear-, fossil- or renewables-based. The power generation technologies have different availabilities, costs, and sustainability indicators. In the present work, the systems analysis of electricity transmission networks is performed, based on the cost, the availability and sustainability indicators. The P-graph framework has been used, where all feasible structural options are enumerated. Naturally, these indicators are inter-dependent; for example, increasing the share of renewables in the overall energy supply for better sustainability may reduce the availability of the system. On the basis of the current work, the sustainability of the transmission network can be maximised without compromising the overall availability. Hungary's electricity transmission network has been examined to illustrate the proposed procedure. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - Process graphs (P-graphs) have been proven to be useful in identifying optimal structures of process systems and business processes. The provision of redundant critical units can significantly reduce operational risk. Redundant units and subsystems can be modelled in P-graphs by adding nodes that represent logical conditions of the operation of the units. It is revealed in this paper that P-graphs extended by logical condition units can be transformed into reliability block diagrams and based on the cut sets and path sets of the graph a polynomial risk model can be extracted. Since the exponents of the polynomial represent the number of redundant units, the cost function of the reliability - redundancy allocation problem as a nonlinear integer programming model can be formalised, where the cost function handles the costs associated with consequences of equipment failure and repair times. The applicability of this approach is illustrated in a case study related to the asset-intensive chemical, oil, gas and energy sector. The results show that the proposed algorithm is useful for risk-based priority resource allocation in a reforming reaction system. © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The aim of this study is to optimise the structural design of a central utility system for a Local Integrated Energy Sector, considering its environmental performance, such that Total Annual Cost is minimised. Environmental performance is captured by Greenhouse Gas emissions, Water, and Particulate Matter (PM) Footprints. To obtain the minimum cost solution, a Utility Systems Planner (USP) tool has been developed within the P-graph framework using a superstructure. The USP is applied to a case study with a chemical processing site and district energy demands. With the historically lower than average coal prices, the optimisation favours a utility system based on a coal boiler (68.4 MW) supplemented by geothermal clean energy plant (3 MW) to satisfy the 53 MW of process heat. Increasing the GHG emissions price from 5 €/t to 20 €/t shifts the optimisation in favour of natural gas as the primary fuel. Further increases in GHG prices to 95 €/t changes the optimal solution to biomass as the fuel with geothermal heat. Solitary focus on GHG emissions and its price, however, overlooks the immediate environmental impact of PM. Policy constraints on PM emissions to be at a safe level reverts the optimal solution to use natural gas as the fuel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar application to soil is a potentially scalable carbon sequestration strategy. In practice, the amount of biochar that can be added to soil is constrained by the presence of contaminants such as salts, heavy metals, or dioxins. Process Systems Engineering (PSE) and Process Integration (PI) methods can be developed to optimize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in such biochar-based Carbon Management Networks (CMNs). Previous works have proposed Mathematical Programming (MP) and Pinch Analysis (PA) approaches to the planning of these systems but are subject to the inherent methodological limitations. In this work, an alternative approach using Process Graph (P-graph) is developed, based on the source-sink matching problem being treated as a special Process Network Synthesis (PNS) problem. A case study is solved to illustrate the P-graph approach. In particular, optimal and near-optimal solutions are generated for the problem, which in real applications presents improved flexibility for purposes of practical decision support.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - Reliability is one of the most important properties of processing systems because of its high level direct effect on the investment and operational costs. Still there is no general method that is capable of simultaneously considering the reliability during the design procedure of processing systems. The main reason of the lack of general method is that the process systems design and the reliability engineering are based on different types of mathematical modeling tools. While process systems design is traditionally considered as mixed-integer optimization, reliability engineering is based on probability theory. The enumeration of the alternative feasible solutions of a redundant processing system is highly combinatorial, and, therefore, it is very difficult if possible to embed it into the widely used mixed-integer programming procedure. For the simultaneous consideration of the costs and reliability in process systems design, general modeling tool is required that can conveniently cover the two areas. In the present work, it has been shown that the formerly developed axioms based combinatorial approach to process network synthesis (PNS), the so-called P-graph framework, can conveniently cover and integrate these two aspects. The interface between the synthesis and the reliability analysis steps of process systems design is established on the basis of the axioms of combinatorially feasible processing networks. Since the combinatorial feasibility and the structural operability are closely related terms, their simultaneous consideration hardly increases the complexity of the procedure. The method for processing systems synthesis with simultaneous consideration of reliability is general and capable of effectively designing complex, highly interconnected processing networks with large number of redundant operations. The focus of the present work is on structures of processing systems, all statements and algorithms are general. The solutions of the synthesis of the HDA process have also been given.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - Systematically exploring candidate reaction pathways of chemical and biochemical reactions has both theoretical and practical importance. For example, on the basis of the understanding of the mechanism of a complex reaction, its yield may be improved. For this reason many works cover issues on the synthesis of reaction pathways for a given reaction. One of the most effective approach is based on P-graph algorithm capable of generating all possible reaction pathways from the starting reactants (precursors) to final products (targets). This method produces the possible topological structures of the reaction based on dynamic equilibrium state, steady-state circumstances. It is, therefore, crucial to know whether these states can be reached from the initial state of the system, i.e., whether the reaction pathway is structurally startable. A novel algorithm is given in the present work that examines the reaction pathways in terms of structural startability. The algorithm has been demonstrated by applying hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane on biactive-site platinum catalysts. The reduction of the number of potential pathways to be examined during the selection of the best reaction mechanism contributes to the efficiency of reaction engineering.

AB  - This study aims to optimise the structural design of industrial central utility systems to while taking full advantage of intra-day electricity spot price fluctuations. Surges renewable electricity generation uptake has amplified the rises and falls between peak and off-peak electricity prices. Industrial Total Sites and Locally Integrated Energy Sectors can take maximum advantage of periods of both low and high electricity prices through appropriate technology investment. Using P-graph, a Utility Systems Planner superstructure is extended to apply a multi-period analysis to optimally select the fuels, energy conversion technologies, and the requires sizes to install for a representative case study. A key difference between the multi-period solution and the single-period solution is an Electric Boiler that operates when the electricity price is low. This results in a Total Annual Cost saving of 7.5 %. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the increasing complexity of human developed systems computer aid plays key role in engineering design involving process synthesis and analysis. The P-graph framework provides effective algorithms implemented in software to synthesize optimal process systems constructed from potential building blocks leading from the available resources to the desired targets. P-graph software computes both the optimal structure and the optimal parameter values of a process system, however, does not provide information on the dynamics of the system synthesized. In contrast Petri nets are tools for simulation and analysis of complex systems' dynamic behavior. They can model the operation of a preliminarily well-defined process network, but they are inappropriate for synthesizing the optimal process structure. The present work suggests joint application of the methods mentioned above combining effective synthesis algorithms from the P-graph framework with the modeling strength of Petri nets, illustrated by identification of feasible reaction pathways.

AB  - A P-graph approach to the general footprint-constrained energy planning problem is proposed in this work as an alternative to pinch analysis and mathematical programming methods previously reported in literature. It has been noted that such energy planning problems have a common underlying structure, regardless of the specific quality index (e.g., carbon intensity, water footprint, inoperability risk, etc.) used to characterize the sources and demands. Application of the P-graph framework to such problems has the added advantage of being able to rigorously identify both optimal and near-optimal solutions, which is a feature that is useful for practical decisionmaking. A literature case study on carbon emission pinch analysis (CEPA) for energy sector planning is used to demonstrate this approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Smart energy systems for smart city districts: case study Reininghaus District
AU  - Maier, Stephan
T2  - Energy, Sustainability and Society
AB  - Background: Dense settlement structures in cities have high demands of energy. Usually, these demands exceed the local resource availability. Individually developed supply options to cover these demands differ from place to place and can also vary within the boundaries of a city. In a common sense of European governance, cities are pushed to save energy, increase renewables and reduce import dependency on fossil fuels. There are many innovative concepts and technologies available to tackle these needs. The paper provides a comprehensive methodology for planning and assessing the development of ‘smart' energy systems leading to complex energy provision technology networks using different on-site as well as off-site resources. Methods: The use of the P-graph (process-graph) method allows the optimisation of energy systems by using different energy sources for heating, storing and cooling. This paper discusses this method in the development of an urban brown field, the premises of the Reininghaus District, a former brewery in the city of Graz in Austria. The case study is interesting as it combines on-site energy sources (e.g. solar heat and photovoltaic) with nearby industrial waste heat and cooling at different temperatures and grid-based resources such as existing district heating, natural gas, and electricity. The case study also includes the competition between centralised technologies (e.g. large scale combined heat and power and heat pumps with district heating grids) and decentralised technologies (e.g. small scale combined heat and power, single building gas boilers, solar collectors, etc. in buildings). Ecological assessment with the Energetic Long-Term Analysis of Settlement Structures (ELAS) calculator provides an evaluation of the ecological impact of the developed energy systems. Results: Different scenarios based on two building standards OIB (low energy house standard) and NZE (passive house standard) as well as different prices for key energy resources were developed for an urban development concept for the Reininghaus District. The results of these scenarios show a very wide spectrum of structures of the energy system with strong variations often caused by small changes in cost or prices. The optimisation shows that small changes in the setup of the price/cost structure can cause dramatic differences in the optimal energy system to supply a smart city district. However, decentralised systems with low-temperature waste heat and decentralised heat pumps in the building groups show the financially most feasible and, compared to alternatives, most ecological way to supply the new buildings. Conclusions: The planning process for the development of the Reininghaus District is a complex and therefore lengthy process and shall be concretised over the next decades. Optimal energy technology networks and scenarios resulting from the application of the described methods support the framework energy plan. The accumulated knowledge can be used to form smart energy supply solutions as an integral part for the discussion of the stakeholders (investors, city department) to guide the forming of their action plan through the development of the city quarter. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, we propose a method and its concomitant software for the identification and assessment of building-evacuation routes. First, the building floor map is represented via P-graphs, thereby facilitating the identification of the evacuation routes. Second, each route identified is transformed into a time-expanded, process-network synthesis (PNSt) problem, which can be algorithmically solved by the P-graph methodology. In the proposed method, each location and passage in the building is defined by a set of attributes to be taken into account in the evacuation-route planning. Third, the evacuation routes are ranked in terms of the evacuation time computed as the minimum cost of the corresponding PNSt problem. Furthermore, the evacuation routes can be ranked according to specific criteria (e.g., bottlenecks, route utilization, etc.). © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Waste water treatment plants not only treat waste water, they can also act as a source of energy. The produced energy is either used to fulfil in-house energy requirements or fed into public energy distribution grids. Research in Austria and other countries has shown that waste water treatment has high energy potential which is yet unexploited. The project "Integration of Wastewater Infrastructure into Regional Energy Supply Concepts" is a national Austrian project which deals with the investigation of energy potentials from waste water treatment. An integration of energy production systems at waste water treatment plants into energy networks to meet energy demands of urban areas can foster economically feasible use of so far wasted energy. In this study the waste water energy system will be optimised using Process Network Synthesis (PNS), based on the p-graph method. PNS-Studio (2011) is utilised to perform this optimisation. Starting from a maximum structure of all possible technological options the programme calculates an optimum energy network as a solution. The ecological evaluation of the scenarios is executed with Sustainable Process Index (SPI) methodology. A free online tool SPIonWeb (2014) is used to calculate ecological footprint of energy production process. The paper discusses the economic and environmental aspect of the PNS-Studio calculations and the different fields of application for the produced resources (heat, electricity and biogas), using a real world case study. Furthermore the approach of integrated waste water treatment plants into regional energy supply infrastructure will be explained. Copyright &copy; 2014, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Optimal Renewable Energy Systems for Smart Cities
AU  - Maier, Stephan

T2  - Computer Aided Chemical Engineering
AB  - Energy systems for smart cities will require on the one hand a much higher share of renewable energy sources for heat and electricity and on the other hand a high standard of integration of industry and utilities supplying households and business. New technological options such as passive buildings, bio-methane injection into grids, small scale CHP with heat storage and PV driven heat pumps for heat provision alter common strategies to supply larger settlements. As energy options become more diverse, heat integration of industry into cities becomes important from economic and ecological considerations. Stabilising distribution grids in the face of diverging supply and demand profiles will further complicate planning of smart city projects. In the face of these challenges, innovative planning tools will gain importance. This paper will discuss using the P-Graph method in its application to sustainable technology systems. This method will be used to generate optimal energy systems linking industry to smart cities and to integrate innovative energy technologies into such systems. The Sustainable Process Index will be used to evaluate these systems from the ecological sustainability point of view. This sustainability measure is particularly well suited to differentiate between conventional fossil based and renewable source based energy systems. A real life case study of the application of these methods to the challenge of designing the optimal energy system for a smart city will be discussed in the paper. The case study deals with a green field development in a medium sized city in Austria (Graz). This project includes different energy provision sources (e.g. excess heat from industry, ground water energy), low energy buildings and innovative storage and energy provision technologies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A computer-aided methodology for designing sustainable supply chains is presented using the P-graph framework to develop supply chain structures which are analyzed using cost, the cost of producing electricity, and two sustainability metrics: ecological footprint and emergy. They represent environmental burden in terms of land use and energy resources. The P-graph framework provides a mathematically rigorous procedure for synthesizing optimal and alternative networks subject to profitability considering ecological footprint and emergy inputs. Emergy is a measure of energy used in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or maintain a service, or in our case, energy production. Emergy and ecological footprint complement each other because they represent very different aspects of sustainability. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with a supply chain whichprovides electric power and heat to an agricultural region utilizing agricultural wastes as renewable resources. The results indicate that, compared to electricity from the grid and/or natural gas, renewable energy resources can yield cost reductions of up to 17. % as well as ecological footprint and emergy reductions. This allows the design of more sustainable supply chains that are both cost-effective and less environmentally damaging. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Computer Aided Chemical Engineering
AB  - Daily competitiveness of a process system highly depends on its flexibility, i.e., how the operation can follow the actual market. However, those processes are seldom flexible, which were not designed and constructed to be. The present paper review different approaches for synthesizing robust process networks, e.g., stochastic optimization (Birge and Louveaux, 2011), stochastic LP optimization (Kall and Mayer, 2005), two stage stochastic MIP optimization (Qin et al., 2013) and the forced incorporation of redundancies in process systems (Bertok et al., 2013). Two stages of the models are distinguished according to the two levels of decisions, i.e., level one for figuring out the investments and level two for controlling the operation. At level one operating units are selected to be involved in the investments and capacities of them are determined according to the estimated future circumstances. At level two start ups, shut downs, and optimal loads of the operating units are defined in agreements with real situations. In the current examination both stages, as well as their relations, are represented by process graphs or P-graphs originally introduced by Friedler et al. (1992) for chemical process design. Optimal decisions are computed according to two stage stochastic optimization, where expected alternative scenarios at level two helps evaluating the consequences of the decisions at level one. As an alternative approach robust systems are to be synthesized by forced installation of redundant capacities. Effectiveness of the methods is illustrated by applying them to supply chain design. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new modeling technique is presented here for handling multi-period operations in process-network synthesis (PNS) problems by the P-graph (process graph) framework. Until now, the P-graph framework could only handle single-period operating units. It means that the operating conditions and the load of each unit remain unchanged throughout its operation. This assumption is usually true for the chemical industry but may be false in agriculture or in other areas where seasonal effects are important. Hence, the current work proposes the notion of multi-period operation wherein the load of an operating unit may vary from period to period. Subsequently, a modeling technique is proposed to represent operating units in the multi-period operation. The idea is to represent separately the physical body of an operating unit and the operations in each period. Surprisingly, to achieve these tasks, there is no need to dramatically change or augment the basic structure of the P-graph methodology, e.g. with a new type of multi-period unit, but the already available constituents are adequate.

AB  - The free movement of goods and the liberalization of the markets in Europe resulted in heavy transport and overloading of motorways and public roads, definitely putting an obstacle to economic growth in the European Union. The further construction and reconstruction of such roads cannot keep pace with the increasing demand, furthermore, puts a heavy burden on the states' budget. Since traffic cannot be increased further more some other solutions must be found. Such an alternative solution could be to develop optional models for logistics. This paper examines the possible usage of the P-graph-based workflow for modeling logistical problems. The application of P-graph-based workflow is justified by the fact that it has already been applied successfully in other fields of industry. Further, the paper will examine the opportunities of P-graph modeling in a specific field of logistics Supply Chain Management, and will also introduce a new term the P-graph based Supply Chain Model.

AB  - Out of the workflow representations that are excellent to model business processes this paper examines the possibilities of the p-graph-based workflow modeling for administrative activities. Taking the special requirements of document management into account it gives a possible solution for document processing, the more reality like modeling of activities and resources. This paper introduces special descriptors for the various document types, activities and resources. Thus making the p-graph based workflow modeling more applicable for the modeling of administrative processes. Beyond the static examinations the extension of the p-graph-based model enables the analysis of dynamic behavior and the analysis of process executions. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Methodology and computer aid were proposed for designing sustainable supply chains in terms of sustainability metrics busing the P-graph framework. The proposed methodology and the software were demonstrated with the optimal design of a supply chain for providing heat and electric power to an agricultural region with relatively limited land area where agricultural wastes can potentially be recovered as renewable resources. Possible sources of heat and electricity included electricity from the Hungarian grid, and heat and electricity generated from natural gas, corn, corn silage, grass silage, or wood or some combination of these sources. Each supply chain was ranked according to cost, and assessed environmental impacts using the ecological footprint (representing land use burden), and emergy (representing energy resource burden). Decisively feasible supply chains were found with cost variations of 2% to -17% compared with using only natural gas and electricity from the Hungarian grid. For these supply chains, the sustainability profile as represented by the ecological footprint varied from 8 to -78%, and the emergy results ranged from -54 to -93%.

AB  - The p-graph-based workflow has been introduced for modeling administrative processes in earlier papers then it was completed with necessary descriptors to conceptualise the dynamic model and we determined the initial model as well as the operational algorithm of the activities. Starting from model this this paper examines the simulation possibilities of workflows modeling administrative processes. The main goal of the simulation is the dynamic analysis of the workflow model, filtering of bottlenecks and the optimization of resources. Considering that we talk about the simulation of administrative processes we look thoroughly into the precise representation of the flow of documents and the simulation of the operation of activities. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - It is highly desirable to develop a software for estimating the quality of supply networks and synthesizing potential alternative realizations to improve the quality of service or to satisfy service level agreements. In the present paper, methodology, algorithm, and software are proposed to improve supply networks where the quality is measured by cost and response time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe methodology is based on the combinatorial foundations of algorithmic process synthesis. Structure generation and evaluation of a supply scenario are the two major steps of the algorithm elaborated for synthesizing the optimal network structure. The algorithm, besides generating alternative structures, takes into account alternative orders of the activities as well. The structural alternatives are evaluated on the basis of the cost and duration of each individual operation. The cost and response time for a single operation are expressed as concave functions of its volume.

AB  - A novel approach is presented for the automated generation of models representing superstructures for the synthesis and optimization of distributed energy supply systems (DESS). Based on a basic problem description (load cases, available technologies, and topographical constraints), the proposed algorithm automatically generates a model accounting for time-varying load profiles and part-load dependent operating efficiencies. Building upon the P-graph approach, the derived superstructure is extended to include multiple redundant conversion units as required for DESS optimization. In the present implementation, a GAMS model is generated that can be readily optimized. The approach is applied to the retrofit synthesis of the energy supply system of an industrial site. It is shown that the automated procedure provides a convenient and efficient optimization framework for DESS. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - P-graph methodology for cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions involving fuel cell combined cycles
AU  - Varbanov, Petar Sabev
AU  - Friedler, Ferenc
AB  - Fuel cells (FCs) are important for building combined energy systems due to their high efficiency. Molten Carbonate FCs (MCFC) and Solid Oxide FCs (SOFC) have been identified as best candidates for FC Combined Cycles (FCCC). This paper presents a procedure for evaluating the trends in emission levels and economics of FCCC based energy conversion systems, utilising biomass and/or fossil fuels. This involves significant combinatorial complexity, efficiently handled by the P-graph algorithms. A procedure for the synthesis of cost-optimal FCCC configurations is developed, accounting for the carbon footprint of the technology and fuel options. The results show that such systems employing renewables can be viable for wide range of economic conditions, due to the high energy efficiency of the FC-based systems. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Industries and cities have different functionalities for society but they share several energy aspects. Industries often produce excess energy (low temperature heat in particular) and cities have a considerable heat demand. Linking cities and industries therefore can be advantageous for both sides. Industries can increase their revenue by selling excess heat and cities can integrate this energy in district heating. In terms of emissions there are several advantages: a central emission source for heat production which can be handled much easier compared to several small heating units, as well as the overall improvement in energy efficiency of the city-industry complex. Important factors for analyzing and optimizing such energy links are the resources for the energy production, district heating costs and time related load profiles. In a first step process synthesis using the P-graph method (Friedler et al., 1995; Halasz et al., 2005, Friedler 2009) is employed to find a stable economical technology network, integrating existing facilities and new technologies (such as CHP and direct solar energy utilization) that use available resources. In a second step this network is evaluated with the help of the Sustainable Process Index (SPI) to indicate ecological hot spots (Narodoslawsky et. al., 1995). A case study in Austria analyses the feasible energy link between a brewery and the neighboured city including possible energy resources and district heating. Copyright © 2010 AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Improved waste stream management will play an ever increasing role among possible energy sources in the future. This paper analyses a waste company situated in Western Austria. Currently a considerable amount of waste is sent to a waste incineration plant. Costs thereby incurred have to be borne by the company. On the other hand heat is required, mainly for waste drying. Therefore an optimal network with an improved internal use of available materials should be generated. Within an economic optimization carried out by the P-graph method (Friedler et al., 1995; Halasz et al., 2005, Friedler, 2010) this network is developed. The results offer a wide range of future scenarios for the waste company, which could enhance the existing process; both from an economical and ecological point of view.

AB  - Novel processing equipment, i.e., an operating unit, such as any of various separators, is continually under development for commercialization. An innovative strategy has been proposed to establish the economically viable target price of such an operating unit through iterative flowsheet syntheses by parametrically reducing its current price. The proposed strategy resorts to a P-graph- (process-graph-) based algorithmic method for process-network synthesis. The strategy has been demonstrated to be highly efficient by determining the target price of the pervaporation unit for downstream processing of biochemically manufactured butanol, ethanol, and acetone. It is worth noting that the proposed strategy for price targeting in developing a novel and immature operating unit, such as pervaporation, is fundamentally different from that involved in retrofitting, which involves only the mature operating units at their current costs. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

At the outset, 116 stoichiometrically feasible independent pathways (Ipi's) have been exhaustively generated within 2 s on a PC through a novel graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs (process graphs) from a set of 17 plausible elementary reactions. This is followed by the determination of IP18 among these 116 stoichiometrically feasible IPi's as the plausibly dominant pathway via energetic analysis. © 2008 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The synthesis of a supply network is profoundly conveluted because of its combinatorial complexity. Global or even near optimal solutions are, more often than not, unobtainable through the heuristic methods. On the other hand, the majority of the algorithmic methods, which mainly resort to mixed integer programming, in theory, can give rise to global optima; however, they are effective only for relatively minute networks. Obviously, it is highly desirable that a novel paradigm be established for optimally synthesizing supply networks; the adoption of the graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs (process graphs) is proposed herein for the synthesis of optimal supply networks. The proposed method is illustrated with examples. Each example has yielded simultaneously the optimal and near optimal structures of the supply network performing a specific task in the ranked order. The example reveals a unique feature of the method. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A hierarchical approach is proposed to estimate the sustainability-potential of a chemical process, based on any of the alternative synthetic routes. This novel notion of sustainability-potential is a generalization of the notion of profit-potential, the estimation of which renders it possible to screen out economically nonviable processes derived from the alternative synthetic routes at the earliest stage. At the outset of assessment, all the individual alternative synthetic routes are identified by the graph-theoretic method based on process graphs (P-graphs). Subsequently, the individual alternative synthetic routes are sequentially assessed in descending order of quantifiability, in terms of available energy (or exergy), dissipation, the possible profit, and the toxicity index, respectively. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated for the manufacture of C2H3Cl. The approach can possibly be adapted for estimating the sustainability-potential to assess the alternative production routes as represented by alternative flowsheets for manufacturing specific products.

AB  - The application of process synthesis to the European sugar industry is a valuable support for decision-making in an industry severely hit by deregulation of agrarian markets. The paper offers a broader view on possible pathways for utilizing sugar beet. Results of sensitivity analysis using the P-graph approach and a branched and bound MINLP optimization method reveal the impact of price variations for ethanol and sugar on the core structure of sugar plants. This information may help to set the strategy for the sugar sector in Europe in the years following deregulation of the market. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Beyond processes - Application of process synthesis to the optimisation of regional economies
AU  - Halász, László

AU  - Narodoslawsky, Michael
AB  - Sustainable development does not only require resource efficient technologies on the plant level but also optimal production networks that are adapted to regional ecological, societal and economical systems. These networks can be seen as highly integrated mass and energy flow networks that can be optimised to obtain the highest economic profit within rigorous environmental boundary conditions, based on societal structures characteristic to the regional setting in consideration. This viewpoint opens regional production networks to the treatment with process synthesis methods as means for rational optimisation in order to construct sustainable production systems. A highly effective combinatorial method introduced by (Friedler et al., 1992a) and based on the process graph or P-graph representation, on the axioms of the combinatorially feasible process structures and combinatorial algorithms (Friedler et al., 1992b), e.g., maximal structure generator (MSG) (Friedler et al., 1993), solution structure generator (SSG), and decision mapping Friedler et al., 1995) was applied to the problem of optimisation of the agricultural sector of Eastern Styria, a region in south east Austria bordering Slovenia and Hungary. Characterised by small farm lots and a very divers agricultural landscape, the region at the moment lives from husbandry, orchards and wine production. In general the agricultural sector of this particular region is not able to produce at world market prices even as it pursues non-sustainable exploitative farming practices and is heavily dependent on subsidies. The project described in this paper envisioned the necessary changes to the agricultural sector over a timeframe of 15 years to make this sector profitable within ecological sustainable conditions.

AB  - A novel holistic approach is proposed for process retrofitting. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed approach totally resynthesizes the entire process by incorporating the operating units with enhanced performances. As such, it can take into account all possible outcomes, including the inevitable restructuring of the flowsheet's network structure. Naturally, the proposed approach can be executed by resorting to the efficient graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs that have been originally devised for synthesizing virgin processes; nevertheless, the approach does not require the enormous effort involved in exhaustively identifying plausible operating units in synthesizing virgin processes. With the combinatorial feasibility of most operating units largely predetermined, the approach detects, with extraordinary speed, any changes in the flowsheet's network structure incurred by retrofitting. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to the retrofitting of a conventional downstream process for the biochemical production of butanol through the incorporation of newly identified adsorbing units. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Cell robustness and complexity have been recognized as unique features of biological systems. This is attributable to the existence of multiple (or redundant) metabolic pathways and the concomitant multiple flux distributions, with each pathway leading to a single phenotype. Moreover, the multiple pathways may result in a variety of products or byproducts under different environmental conditions, e.g., substrate concentration, PH, and temperature. Appropriately controlling environmental or genetic conditions renders it possible to maximize the rate of substrate conversion and the production of a desired product or products by circumventing the occurrence of the secondary reactions yielding undesirable intermediates and byproducts. As such, we would enable us to devise or design biochemical manufacturing processes with enhanced energy efficiency and robustness; the resultant processes would be capable of increasing the rates of production, thereby lowering their costs. Proposed herein is an effective approach for exploring metabolic pathways, which algorithmically synthesizes all the candidate pathways by a rigorous graph-theoretic method based on P-graphs (process graphs).

AB  - An overview is presented for a rigorous graph-theoretic method to exhaustively identify the candidate mechanisms of catalytic chemical and biochemical reactions. The method has been designed according to the general framework of a highly exacting combinatorial method established for process-network synthesis. It is based on the unique graph-representation in terms of P-graphs, a set of axioms, and a group of combinatorial algorithms. The results of successful applications of the algorithm to some catalytic chemical and biochemical reactions are presented. These reactions include catalytic reaction of ammonia synthesis; ethylene hydrogenation; combustion of hydrogen; reduction of nitrogen dioxide; formation of hydrogen bromide; ethanol production; etc. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 7th World Congress of Chemical Engineering (Glasgow, Scotland 7/10-14/2005).

AB  - Manufacturing butanol, ethanol, and acetone through grain fermentation has been attracting increasing research interest. In the production of these chemicals from fermentation, the cost of product recovery constitutes the major portion of the total production cost. Developing cost-effective flowsheets for the downstream processing is, therefore, crucial to enhancing the economic viability of this manufacturing method. The present work is concerned with the synthesis of such a process that minimizes the cost of the downstream processing. At the outset, a wide variety of processing equipment and unit operations, i.e., operating units, is selected for possible inclusion in the process. Subsequently, the exactly defined superstructure with minimal complexity, termed maximal structure, is constructed from these operating units with the rigorous and highly efficient graph-theoretic method for process synthesis based on process graphs (P-graphs). Finally, the optimal and near-optimal flowsheets in terms of cost are identified.

AB  - The issues of waste generation in batch process plants differ in many aspects to continuous plants. Despite the smaller-scale of processing, complexities from unsteady state profiles, discontinuities, and run-to-run variations make waste minimization in batch plant more challenging. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology for waste minimization analysis of a batch process. The methodology consists of three fundamental elements: process graph (P graph) for process recipe assessment and path flow analysis of waste material and cause-and-effect and functional knowledge for evaluating the process recipe and equipment variables connectivity. The application of the methodology is illustrated through an alcohol washing case study.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for solving the probabilistic diagnosis problem in multiprocessor systems. The main idea of the algorithm is based on the reformulation of the diagnostic procedure as a P-graph model. The same, well-elaborated mathematical paradigm - originally used to model material flow - can be applied in our approach to model information flow. This idea is illustrated by deriving a maximum likelihood diagnostic decision procedure. The diagnostic accuracy of the solution is considered on the basis of simulation measurements, and a method of constructing a general framework for different aspects of a complex problem is demonstrated with the use of P-graph models.

AB  - It is inordinately difficult to optimise the steam-supply system of a chemical complex under the condition that the production capacities of a multitude of products vary temporarily. Any of the available general-purpose methods for optimal design and operation hardly suffices for this purpose; therefore, a specific-purpose method has been developed in the current work. The efficacy of the resultant method is illustrated by optimising the steam-supply system of an existing chemical complex. The complex consists of one power-plant; one boiler station; four production plants operated in batch; one production plant operated continuously; and one pipeline network. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

T2  - Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research
AB  - A highly effective method has been established to identify processing or operating units necessary for the design or synthesis of azeotropic-distillation systems by resorting to the first principles and logical sequencing of such units. The materials represented in the space of the residue curve map are partitioned into lumped materials bounded by the thermodynamic boundaries and pinches. Subsequently, the operating units are identified on the basis of these lumped materials. The efficacy of the method has been amply illustrated by generating some feasible flowsheets with a set of relatively simple heuristics for the process of producing pure ethanol from its aqueous solution via azeotropic distillation, which is a typical complex process involving thermodynamic pinches, such as azeotropes, phase transition, and/or phase separation. The method is applicable to other complex processes, e.g., crystallization, extraction, reactive distillation, and their combinations. It is highly likely that the method can be an integral part of any conventional heuristic or algorithmic flowsheeting procedure because selecting plausible or candidate operating units is essential for synthesizing a flowsheet by any procedure.

AB  - A graph-theoretic method for integration of process and control system (IPCS) syntheses with different controllability notions has been proposed in the present paper. The foundation of this integration is a well-established, graph-theoretic approach to process synthesis in conjunction with the analysis of structural controllability based on digraph-type process models. Unambiguous structural representation of the resultant integrated process and control systems, IPXS structures in brief, has been introduced for unambiguous representation of a process structure, it is rendered possible as an extension of the directed bipartite graph, the P-graph. Different set of axioms are proposed for describing the case of disturbance-rejective regulable and the combinatorially feasible and controllable structures in the special cases considered: the case of structural controllability and the case of fault-tolerant controllability. These axioms make the synthesis computationally more effective by considering very simple engineering knowledge. The maximal controllable structure of an IPXS synthesis problem has been defined as the union of combinatorially feasible and controllable IPXS structures. Thus, the mathematical programming model, e.g. MINLP model, of an IPXS synthesis problem can be and should be derived from the maximal controllable structure. Different versions of a fundamental polynomial time, combinatorial algorithm are presented for identifying the maximal controllable structure. The resultant IPXS structures are compared with the structures synthesized without considering their control systems. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analyses of network problems have yielded mathematically and practically significant results. Naturally, it should be of substantial interest to extend such results to a general class of network problems where the structure of any system can be represented by a directed bipartite graph containing two types of vertices; the model for one of them is nonlinear. This class of problems is frequently encountered in the design of process systems for carrying out transformation of chemical or material species through physical, chemical, or biological means. General-purpose mathematical programming methods have failed so far to solve large-scale network problems involved in the design of such systems. This paper is intended to define this class of network problems, i.e., the problems of process network synthesis, and to elucidate the unique features of these problems.

AB  - Process Network Synthesis (PNS) has enormous practical impact; however, its mixed integer programming (MIP) model is tedious to solve because it usually involves a large number of binary variables. The present work elucidates the recently proposed accelerated branch-and-bound algorithm that exploits the unique feature of the MIP model of PNS. Implementation of the algorithm is based on the so-called decision-mapping that consistently organizes the system of complex decisions. The accelerated branch-and-bound algorithm of PNS reduces both the number and size of the partial problems. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated with a realistic example.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Science
AB  - Decisions involved in process synthesis are often more complex than those involved in other disciplines. This arises from the fact that such decisions are concerned with specification or identification of highly interconnected systems, e.g. process structures, which may contain a multitude of recycling loops. It appears that no rigorous technique is available, which is capable of representing exactly and organizing efficiently the system of decisions for a process synthesis problem. A novel mathematical notion, decision-mapping, has been introduced in this work to render the complex decisions in process design and synthesis consistent and complete. The basic terminologies of decision-mapping, including extension, equivalence, completeness, complementariness, and active domain, have been defined based on rigorous set-theoretic formalism, and the most important properties of decision-mappings have been identified and proved. Decision-mapping, as a rigorously established technique, is directly applicable in developing efficient and exact process synthesis methods or improving existing methods. The applicability and meritorious features of this new technique are illustrated by synthesizing a large scale process. © 1995.

AB  - The previously developed method for integrated process and control system (IPCS) synthesis (Hangos et al., 1994) has been extended to the cases for which process safety or reliability is of primary concern. An unambiguous representation of the resultant integrated process and fault-tolerant control system structure, IPFCS structure in brief, is rendered possible through the CP-graph originally proposed for IPCS synthesis. A new axiom for the fault-tolerant controllability is established; it states that more than one independent control path are required for each controlled variable. The fundamental combinatorial algorithm of IPCS synthesis, i.e., algorithm CMSG, has been revised so that the modified set of axioms is capable of identifying the controllable, fault-tolerant structures of an IPFCS synthesis problem. The efficacy of the proposed method for IPFCS synthesis method is demonstrated with a relatively simple example by systematically varying the level of the fault tolerance. © 1995.

AB  - The maximal structure, which can be expressed as a process graph (P-graph), is the union of all combinatorially feasible process structures of a synthesis problem. This is analogous to the conventionally used term "superstructure" which has not yet been defined mathematically, and thus, cannot be analyzed mathematically. Since a mathematical programming method of process synthesis requires a mathematical model, as its input, based on the super or maximal structure, generating this structure is a problem of fundamental importance. Algorithm MSG, presented here, appears to be the first published algorithm for generation of the maximal structure. This algorithm is efficient because its complexity is polynomial. It is, therefore, advantageous for solving large industrial process synthesis problems. The mathematical basis of maximal structure, the proof of all statements and validation of algorithm MSG are also presented. ?? 1993.

T2  - Chemical Engineering Science
AB  - An innovative approach, based on both graph theory and combinatorial techniques has been proposed for facilitating the synthesis of a process system. In contrast to other general purpose mathematical programming methods, this innovative approach is designed to cope with the spscificities of a process system: it represents the structure of a process system by a unique bipartite graph, termed a P-graph, and captures not only the syntactic but also the semantic contents of the process system. An axiom system underlying the approach has been constructed to define the combinatorially feasible process structures. This axiom system is based on a given set of specificatios for the process synthesis problem. Such specifications include the types of operating units and the raw materials, products, by-products, and a variety of waste associated with these operating units. All feasible structures of the process system are embedded in the maximal structure, from which individual solution-structures can be extracted subject to various technical, environmental, economic, and societal constraints. Various theorems have been derived from the axiom system to ensure that this approach is mathematically rigorous, thereby rendering it possible to develop efficient process synthesis methods on the basis of a rigorous mathematical foundation. Examples are presented to highlight the significance and efficacy of the present approach. ?? 1992.

AB  - Key Words. Process control; control system synthesis; structural controllability; combinatorial mathematics; synthesis methods Abstract A graph-theoretic method for integration of process and control system (IPCS) syntheses has been proposed in the present paper. The foundation of this integration is a well-established, graph-theoretic approach to process synthesis in conjunction with the analysis of structural controllability based on digraph-type process models. A directed bipartite graph, the CP-graph, has been introduced for unambiguous representation of an {IPCS} structure. The notion of CP-graph has given rise to a set of axioms for describing the combinatorially feasible and controllable structures. The maximal controllable structure of an {IPCS} synthesis problem has been defined as the union of combinatorially feasible and controllable {IPCS} structures; obviously, the optimal {IPCS} structure must be a substructure of this maximal controllable structure. Thus, the mathematical programming model, e.g., {MINLP} model, of an {IPCS} synthesis problem should be derived from the maximal controllable structure. The fundamental combinatorial algorithm of {IPCS} synthesis, i.e., algorithm CMSG, for identifying this maximal controllable structure has been formulated. The complexity of this algorithm has been proved to be polynomial on the size of the problem; its efficacy is illustrated with a relatively simple example. The resultant {IPCS} structures are compared with the structures synthesized without considering their control systems.

AB  - This paper introduces the utilization of two different optimization models as a decision-making tool for municipal solid waste management. This study aims to provide a framework of decision-making in managing municipal solid waste in Malaysia and demonstrating the function model’s potential for a decision-making tool. Process network synthesis is used as a first optimization model to generate feasible pathways for municipal solid waste conversion technologies. A standard data mining technique using machine learning was applied for a simple case study of municipal solid waste management. Data were divided with a ratio of 90:10 for training and testing data and further analysis using different model functions. The model functions involved are linear regression, multilayer perceptron neural network, and sequential minimal optimization regression. The linear regression function provides a better correlation coefficient than other models, 0.5894. The correlation coefficient for testing data slightly increases. The multilayer perceptron model improved its correlation coefficient when inputting the testing dataset. The multilayer perceptron model’s correlation coefficient reached 0.7169 compared to the linear regression function. Therefore, this case study used the multilayer perceptron model as a basis. Results showed that both integrations of optimization models could be successfully used as a basis in waste management decision-making tools with good performance. The decision-making tool provides a faster and efficient way for the user and stakeholder to manage municipal solid waste. Developing a decision-making tool framework for municipal solid waste management can help achieve better municipal solid waste management.

AB  - Since the combinatorial version of the process network synthesis problem is NP-complete, it is important to establish such methods which render possible the reduction of the size of the model. In this work, a new method called merging reduction is introduced which is based on merging of operating units. The mergeable operating units are determined by an equivalence relation on the set of the operating units, and all of the operating units included in an equivalence class are merged into one new operating unit. This reduction has the following property: an optimal solution of the original problem can be derived from an optimal solution of the reduced problem and conversely. Presentation of this reduction technique is equipped with an empirical analysis on randomly generated problems which shows the measure of the size decrease.

AB  - Water security is one of the pressing challenges in sustainable cities of the future as the demand for freshwater increases along with the environmental stresses caused by climate change. For example, Metro Manila, Philippines, experienced a water crisis brought by increasing demand and lasting impacts of climate change in 2019. In response, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), together with its water concessionaires, Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad), and Manila Water Company, Inc. (Manila Water), laid out a water infrastructure plan to bridge the water deficit. However, the decision-making process can be iterative and participatory characterized by uncertainty. This study thus proposed decision-making framework to explore the possibility of alternative sustainable water supply networks in Metro Manila through P-graph and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Alternatives considered were saltwater desalination, rainwater harvesting, and non-revenue water (NRW) recovery. A sustainable network was defined as having low operational (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX), high water security, and low global warming potential (GWP). Relative weights of sustainability, derived through AHP, showed that water security was the most important sustainability criterion among the surveyed experts in water supply construction and operations. P-graph simulations yielded optimal and near-optimal solutions indicating the possibility of not including the controversial water supply infrastructure project (Kaliwa dam) as a prioritized management option. Instead, sustainable supply networks relied on desalination, rainwater harvesting, and NRW recovery are identified as the main components of the optimal water supply network. Overall, the study suggests that better planning and accounting for sustainability is needed to identify and implement projects that do not only serve the short-term needs but also integrate well into the long-term plans.

TI  - Synthesis of Integrated Vertical Farming Systems with Multiperiodic Resource Availability
AU  - Pimentel, Jean
AU  - Friedler, Ferenc
T2  - Chemical Engineering Transactions
AB  - Vertical farming (VF) has been proposed as an approach to decrease the land required for growing agricultural products. This technique consists of growing produce in vertical orientation within a controlled environment. However, one of the most significant barriers for its implementation is the uncertain economic feasibility, derived from the elevated consumption of energy and the high investment costs. A strategy to enhance VF efficiency proposes its integration with municipal infrastructure, thus establishing closed-loop systems where VF seizes organic waste, manure, CO2, and excess energy from productive plants and local power stations. Because of the economic uncertainty of its development, the optimal synthesis of such a closed-loop system (i.e., the selection and specification of its components, and their connections) is of utmost importance for the implementation of this strategy. The difficulty of the synthesis task arises from the combinatorial nature of the problem and the variability of the resources and market conditions in time. This work employs a graph-theoretic approach for the synthesis of a closed-loop system of VF considering the variability of the resources during multiple periods of operation. The proposed method relies on the P-graph framework which permits the identification of the n-best alternatives for the system’s design, employing the properties of the problem’s structure to enhance the effectiveness of the solution procedure. Consequently, the most cost-effective systems are identified together with their policy of operation for the different periods. This method constitutes a powerful tool for the assessment of systems for VF integration that enhance the sustainability of agricultural activity.

AB  - There is utmost urgency to decarbonize the various industry sectors to keep the global temperature increase within adaptable levels. The P-graph framework is a tool that can support the network design and optimization of new and integrated decarbonization and carbon management systems. An advantage of the P-graph is the capability to determine optimal and near-optimal network solutions that aid decision-making. P-graph is commonly applied in planning supply chain networks and designing reaction pathways and mechanisms but can also be used in designing and optimizing systems to reduce carbon emissions. This work surveys the P-graph literature on decarbonization and Carbon Management Networks (CMNs). Bibliometric analysis is used to identify the trends, knowledge gaps, and potential future research areas. P-graph studies related to biomass and renewable energy are dominant research areas in this sub-area of study. Emerging topics include bio-hydrogen renewable energy, Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Trend analysis suggests that P-graph approaches to biorefineries, product design, uncertainty, and risk analysis will continue to grow. Other combined techniques with P-graph such as the use of sustainability indicators, reliability and criticality analysis, multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA), Life Cycle Optimization (LCO), and Monte Carlo simulation extend the capabilities of P-graph. A knowledge gap exists in P-graph approaches to green ammonia, solar, hydroelectric, and other renewable energy sources and products, which points to potential research opportunities.

AB  - Process integration is a technique that allows to plan and design better systems by considering the whole chemical process rather than breaking it down into components. The synthesis of processes using these techniques starts with the reaction to generate the desired product. One of the techniques in reactor design is the attainable region (AR) theory. It involves determining the space of possible products yields from a reaction using geometric techniques. The development of AR approach addresses the limitation of optimization techniques used in chemical reactor design and process synthesis. However, the continuous feasible space of reaction yields lacks a framework for determining which points would be best given certain environmental and economic constraints. In this study, a P-graph approach is used to implement the AR technique to generate optimal and near-optimal reaction pathways. The approach involves determining the combinations of reacting species to produce one unit flow rate of a desired product based on material, energy, and work balance. Using the P-graph approach allows framing the AR technique as a mathematical programming tool by considering the flow rate limits and economic value of the reactants and side products.  A case study involving methanol synthesis is used to illustrate the approach.

AB  - P-graph is a popularly used framework for process network synthesis (PNS) and network topological optimization. This short communication introduces a Python interface for Pgraph to serve as a linkage to modern programming ecosystems. This allows for a wider application of the fast and efficient P-graph solver, to provide structural and topological enumeration in numerous fields. The proposed framework allows for more integrative usage in Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, process system engineering, chemical engineering and chemometrics. Large and repetitive topologies can also be automated using the new programming interface, saving time and effort in modelling. This short communication serves as a demonstration of the newly developed open-sourced Pgraph interface.

AB  - Designing effective wastewater treatment networks is challenging because of the large number of treatment options available for performing similar tasks. Each treatment option has variability in cost and contaminant removal efficiency. Moreover, their mathematical models are highly nonlinear, thus rendering them computa­ tionally intensive. Such systems yield mixed-integer nonlinear programming models which cannot be solved properly with contemporary optimization tools that may result in local optima or may fail to converge. Herein, the P-graph framework is employed, thus generating all potentially feasible process structures, which results in simpler, smaller mathematical models. All potentially feasible process networks are evaluated by nonlinear programming resulting in guaranteed global optimum; furthermore, the ranked list of the n-best networks is also available. With the proposed tool, better facilities can be designed handling complex waste streams with minimal cost and reasonable environmental impact. The novel method is illustrated with two case studies showing its computational effectiveness.
