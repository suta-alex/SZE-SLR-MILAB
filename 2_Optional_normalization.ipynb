    "### The **normalization step** of the proposed SLR design aims to normalize the authors and affiliations that are variables of the SLR_database based on a set of “Label”-“Replace by” rules. \n",
    "This step has not been specified as it can be conducted in several ways, including Python, or the VOSviewer software. The technical steps include:\n",
    "1.\tRead thesaurus files that contain the Label-Replace by rules as a dictionary. The Label-Replace by rules consists of a set of pairs in which a \"Label\" is associated with a \"Replace by\" value.\n",
    "2.\tLoop through the list of affiliations and authors and for each item, check if any Label exists in it.\n",
    "3.\tIf a Label is found in an author or affiliation, replace it with its corresponding Replace by value using the dictionary created in step 1.\n",
    "4.\tAdd the normalized author and affiliation to a new list.\n",
    "5.\tAfter processing all the authors and affiliations in the SLR_database, overwrite the original authors and affiliations with the normalized ones.\n",
    "6.\tReturn the updated SLR_database.\n"
